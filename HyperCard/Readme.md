HyperCard is a software application and development kit for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. It is among the first successful hypermedia systems predating the World Wide Web.

HyperCard combines a flat-file database with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface.[3] HyperCard includes a built-in programming language called HyperTalk for manipulating data and the user interface.

### SuperCard

**NOTE:** As of August 2021, SuperCard 4.8.1 is not compatible with macOS Catalina or later due to the removal of 32-bit application support in macOS.

**SuperCard** is a high-level development environment that runs on Macintosh computers, under OS 8 and 9, and OS X. It is inspired by HyperCard, but includes a richer language, a full GUI toolkit, and native color (as opposed to HyperCard's Apple- or third-party-supplied add-ons).
