# Diceware

*“Please confirm that no one has ever had a copy of your private key and that it uses a strong passphrase. Assume your adversary is capable of one trillion guesses per second.”* - /**Edward Snowden**, *January 2013*/

Each word from the Diceware list (7,776) is worth about 12.92 bits of entropy (because 212.92 is about 7,776).

Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness of a system. The concept is a difficult one to grasp fully and is confusing, even to experts. Strictly speaking, any given passphrase has an entropy of zero because it is already chosen. It is the method you use to randomly select your passphrase that has entropy. Entropy tells how hard it will be to guess the passphrase itself even if an attacker knows the method you used to select your passphrase. A passphrase is more secure if it is selected using a method that has more entropy.
Entropy is measured in bits. The outcome of a single coin toss — “heads or tails” — has one bit of entropy.

	- *Five words* are breakable with a thousand or so PCs equipped with high-end graphics processors. (Criminal gangs with botnets of infected PCs can marshal such resources.)
- 	*Six words* may be breakable by an organization with a very large budget, such as a large country's security agency. 
- 	*Seven words* and longer are unbreakable with any known technology, but may be within the range of large organizations by around *2030*. 
- 	*Eight words* should be completely secure through *2050*.

Arnold G. Reinhold - /Diceware   / [FAQ](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#entropy) 

For medium security (64 bit entropy), we recommend a user key with a minimum of 15 random letters, or 5 short words selected at random from a dictionary  [(see the Diceware page for an easy way to do this)](http://www.diceware.com/) . For high security, use 20 random letters or seven Diceware words. (90 bit entropy).
