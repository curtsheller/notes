All threre are common keys for songs in the "Jazz" repertoire. And, will insure you are covering the four voicings in pratical and functional areas of the ukulele fingerboard. Depending on the scale of the ukulele (soprano, concert, tenor) somes voicing are not practical BUT need to be explored - hence the different keys.


# Fingerpicking Patter

Just like a strumming pattern we need at least one go to patter that we cn pull off on-demand without out much thought.

Here is a core fingerpicking pattern based on one of the famous four strums.

```
 String:  4  2  3  1  *  2  3  1 
 Count    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  + 
 Attack:  =  =  =  =  *  =  =  =
```

- \* This string four skipped in the underline pattern this variation is based on. This creates a nice syncopated pattern.
