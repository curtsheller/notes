## Rhythm

Music is: **Melody**, **Harmony** (chords and progressions), and **Rhythm**. Rhythm is often neglected and is the one component that one can really feel if it is off in a performance or band.

Strums are "Rhythm". Here is a [series](https://learningukulele.com/series/49) that starts with the Four Famouse Strums i.e., very common strumming patterns.

### Book: Modular Phonetic Rhythm, The Foundation and Workbook 1

- [Modular Phonetic Rhythm, The Foundation and Workbook 1](https://learningukulele.com/books/code/MPRS-FW1), this is the book that I use, with great success for all students.

- Level II Pairs [Worksheet](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/MPR22)

These are 36 rhythm pairs that are in turn 36 possible strumming and fingerpicking patterns.

	- Monotone (on single notes)
	- Single Chord
	- Switch Chords
	- Improvised Melody

The only thing to watch out for on ukulele is, if strumming down and up, to always strum on the down on the downbeat. This locks us in with the "pulse" of the rhythm and is typically associates to the downbeats.
