# A to Z Blues

- Transpose to key of G. On to Examples I.

Any V, Seventh chord that resolve to what would be its I chord that is a minor resolution. Alter the fifth of the V chord. This helps with resolution. Example: A7 to Dm7 is a V to Im resolution.

The II V is a "Large" part of "Jazz" and "Jazz" Blues. It's everywhere.

# Improv, Solos

- Scales: Dorian, Mixolydian
- Arpeggios
	- Triads
	- Triads PLus 1 (the one for major based chords, which include seventh chords. The Ninth/Second is always a safe good choice)

## Rhythm

- tHE **Level I** and **Level II** Rhythmic Syllables are the foundation rhythmic syllables to use for creating solos, licks, rifs, etc.
- **Level II** * [Modular Phonetic Rhythm, Level II Pairs Worksheet](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/MPR22)
	- **Level IIT** * "T" stands for tie.
		- Mid-bar (Need to create this lesson, I thought I had it up there). Basically the end of one Rhythmic Syllable can tie top the befinning of the next Rhythmic Syllable.
		- Cross-bar [Level II Rhythmic Pairs - Anticipation, Crossbar Line](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/MPR22-IIT-Barline) * This worksheet is for exploring the Level II Rhythmic Pairs with a crossbar tie. This is typical for melodies and chords that are anticipated over the barline, a half beat or more early.
