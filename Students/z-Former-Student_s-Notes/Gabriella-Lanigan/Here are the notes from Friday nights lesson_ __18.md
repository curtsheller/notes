# Scales

## Major Scale

### G Major: G A F C D E F# G'

- **Legato**: let each note right until next note.
- **Stacatto**: short notes, don't ring until next notes.

- [**Major Scale Fingering - Piano** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/PL01)

For the Scale: C D E F G A B C' play:
- *Right hand only*
- *Left hand only*
- *Both left hand and right hand together*

- Together
- Staggered: LH, RH, LH, RH, ...
- Staggered: RH, LH, RH, LH, ...

# Chords

- Major: Steps 4 and 4. C is C E G, 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the C Major scale.
- Minor: Steps 3 and 4. Cm is C Eb G, 1st flat 3rd, and 5th of C Major scale.

## Three Inversion

1. Root Position
2. 1st Inversion
3. 2nd Inversion

## Triads

Triads are the most common chord we play and are only three notes.

- [**Piano Chords - Traditional Triads** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/PL02)

### To create a Major triad:
Find the note that is the letter name of the chord? This is the capital letter that is part of the chord name and chord symbols of the chord. Count up Four black and white keys (*not including the one you are currently on*). This is the second note of the chord. Then count up Three black and white keys (*not including the one you are currently on*). This is the third and last note of the chord.
- Major Triad Step Formula: **4** and **3**
A Major chord is the most common chord we typically play and the default is the chord type is not required to say or write. A C major chord is "C" or "C major".

- **C** is C E G
- **D** is D F# A
- **E** is E G# B
- **F** is F A C
- **G** is G B D
- **A** is A C# E
- **B** is B D# F#

# Technique Drills
## Five-finger Positions and Five-Finger exercises

### Five-finger Positions on White Keys
Put your hands on the piano so that the fingers of each hand are over, or barely resting on five adjacent white keys. Your hands need not be together. Your hands are now in “five-finger positions.” Make sure your fingers aren’t leaning on the keys such that they’re already depressed.

### Five-finger Exercises on White Keys
Let each note ring until the next note, this called “Legato”.
The opposite is “staccato”, short notes that do not sustain until the next note.

#### Variations

- Rhythmic variation: Make some notes longer and some shorts.
- Dynamics: Make some notes louder and some softer.

### Four Variations

#### Simultaneous Contrary Motion

- Right Hand (RH): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2
- Left Hand (LH): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2

Play both hands at the same time: thumbs, index, middle, ring, pinky, ring, middle, etc. Repeat over and over in and even tempo.

Contrary Motion is when, musically, one line of a two-part line is moving up or down and the other line is moving in the opposite direction.

There are no wrong notes, as this is a technical exercise to develop your fingering.

#### Simultaneous Parallel Motion
This, conversely, sounds easy, but feels harder:
- RH: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2
- LH: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

Both lines or moving together and in a parallel motion.

#### Staggered Contrary Motion

Simple "stagger", alternating the notes from on hand to the other. LR/RH and, or RH LH.


#### Staggered Parallel Motion

Simple "stagger", alternating the notes from on hand to the other. LR/RH and, or RH LH.
