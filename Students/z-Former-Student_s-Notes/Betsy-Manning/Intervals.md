# Intervals

Here is a the series intervals: [**Understanding Intervals** &Rarr;](https://learningukulele.com/series/code/UL31)

The book [**Daily Practice Material for Ukulele** &Rarr;](https://learningukulele.com/books/code/PMG1UKE) has the interavls written out in standard music notation. A bit easier to see the what goes on ascending and descending in music notarion.

The most common intervals used in melodies, liks, riff, and suck are: are **2nds**, **3rds**, and **6ths**.

I always start off with 3rds.

# Chords: Triads

We didn't go over these in the lesson:

Start with theses: Triads - [**Traditional and Contemporary Triads** &Rarr;](https://learningukulele.com/series/code/UL42-TRI)

Trais are soooo valuable for, not only as chords but melodies, composed or improvised.
