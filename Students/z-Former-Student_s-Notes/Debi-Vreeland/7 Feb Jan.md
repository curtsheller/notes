# Movable Form Chords
- [Movable Form Ukulele Chords =>>](https://learningukulele.com/series/code/UL37) - Movable Chords are chords without open strings that can be transposed to any key up and down the fingerboard. This series covers the movable chords based on the basic open position chords as well as contemporary 4-part, a.k.a. "jazz" chords.

All the *Movable Form Chords* are based off an [**Open Positions Chord** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/series/71)

# Reggae Strum
- [pg 22 of A Guide to Ukulele Strums =>>](https://learningukulele.com/books/code/UKESTRUM1) - We use the first examples an the followed by a single up stroke.

```
d   u u     u  
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 
```
This two beat pattern is repeated over and over. Each down stroke hits string four and two with the up strokes on three four.
You can add the other variations in the [**A Guide to Ukulele Chords** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/books/code/UKESTRUM1) to taste. We'll explore these and more.
