# Single Note Picking

For single note picking I use my thumb for down strokes index, middle for ups.

## Exercises

### 8 Times each Single String

This is using the "Free Stroke", where you don't follow through the next lower string. This is the same technique that we use for the Alternating Thumb Style.

The other style is the Classical pima style where they also use the "Rest Stroke", where you follow through to the next lower string and come the "rest", on that string. For single note picking its common the alternate using index (i) and middle (m) - im, mi

1. Thumb ALL Down
2. Index All Up
3. Middle ALL Up
4. Alternate Thumb Index
5. Alternate Thumb Index Middle

The decrease the number of times to 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 time each single string.

For all fingering drills perform then ascending strings four the one and descending strings one the four. 

#### Variations

- Vary the rhythm
- Start one different frets
- Descending first then Ascending
- Start on any string
- Skip strings

# Strums / Rhythm

Strums are rhythm. So mastering rhythm will allow you to apply that knowledge and skill to "executing" various rhythmic patterns a.k.a., strumming.

- [SERIES: **Modular Phonetic Rhythm by Chuck Anderson** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/series/code/MPR) * This is the book and lessons that I use with ALL students, with great success. It's using this system when I "finally" got a handle on rhythm.
- [BOOK: **Modular Phonetic Rhythm, The Foundation and Workbook 1** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/books/code/MPRS-FW1)

## Worksheets
- [**Modular Phonetic Rhythm System, Level I Worksheet** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/assets/code/MPR21)
- [**Modular Phonetic Rhythm System, Level II Worksheet** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/assets/code/MPR22)
- [**Modular Phonetic Rhythm System, Level III Worksheet** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/assets/code/MPR23)
- [**Modular Phonetic Rhythm System, Level IV Worksheet** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/assets/code/MPR24)


Level I and II are the levels that we operate in and use the most.

### Rhythm Practice Tips
- Use a metronome and start slow and increase mm a few clicks at a time till above 120 bpm. At that point, you are starting to internalize the counting and are associating the sound with the symbols.
- Start with Monotone, one note
- Single chord
- Switch between two easy chords like C to G7.
- Improvise, running through scales using the worksheets.

## The Strums Part

My book A Guide to Ukulele Strums and the workshop I did uses the Modular Phonetic Rhythm System to organize and learn the strums.

- [WORKSHOP: **Essential Strums for Ukulele - A Guide to Ukulele Strums** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/workshops/code/UW-UKESTRUM1)

# Chords: Triads

- [SERIES: **Triads - Traditional and Contemporary Triads** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/series/code/UL42-TRI)
	- Start with this lesson after reviewing the Introduction. [Lesson: **Core \`Ukulele Chords, Major and Minor Triads, Strings 1 2 3** =>> ](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/UL42-TRIa)
		- [Lessons: **Exploring Major Triads on Ukulele Using a I IV I V Progression - C Major** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/759)


# Scales

- [**Navigating the C Major Scale**, Every Finger, Every String =>>](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/UL6SUF-CMaj)
- [**Navigating the CMajor Scale - Low G** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/UL6SUF-CMaj-Low-G)

After mastering the Navigating the C Major Scale, the high 'G' lesson. Adding string four will not really be a that had.

The above lessons uses the C Major Scale: C D E F G A B C. After spending a lot of time with C Major explore G Major: G A  C D E F# G' and F Major: F G A Bb C D E F'. With G major and F major having only one note difference between C major, it's actually somewhat easy to just use the C major scale fingering and change that one note that is different for the new scale.
