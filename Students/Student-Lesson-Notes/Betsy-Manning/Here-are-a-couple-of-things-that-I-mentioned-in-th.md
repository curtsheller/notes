Here are a couple of things that I mentioned in the lesson.

# Chords

## Traditional and Contemporary Triads 

We talked about triads. Here is a series that I have: [Triads - Traditional and Contemporary Triads ==>](https://learningukulele.com/series/code/UL42-TRI)

Triads are Sooooooo... valuable for gettingto that next leavel.


# Learning the uKulele Fingerboard: Notes of the Neck

Here is the series for really learning that: [**Learning the Ukulele Fingerboard ==>**](https://learningukulele.com/series/code/UL07)

This series takes a step-by-step approach to finally learning the fingerboard. If there's one thing that has the biggest return on your time and investment to learn it's really, really knowing the names of the note of the guitar fingerboard. This series takes a step-by-step approach to finally learning the fingerboard.

In student's lesson book the "Note of the Neck" is always the first item in the lessons book. And, I ask what are the notes at fret (?). My frets order is: open, (5), (7), (2), (10), (4), (9). The student needs to know these from Nose to Toes and then we cycle back and do Toes to Nose. Then we still go at is vatious differetn ways.

Lucklily the Notes of the Neck can be practiced without a ukulele.


Turns out there are few thinkgs that can be done in music away from your instrument.

# Rhythm

## Book
- [**Modular Phonetic Rhythm, The Foundation and Workbook 1 ==>**](https://learningukulele.com/books/code/MPRS-FW1)

## Struming Series

- [**Building Your Core Strums for Ukulele ==>**](https://learningukulele.com/series/code/UL126)

Rhythm is in-separately linked to strums. Using the Modular Phonetic Rhythm System developed by Chuck Anderson this series of lessons start with the core four strums all ukulele players use and throughly digs in to the many variations possible.

As rhythm are in-separately linked with strums these lessons are suitable for any stringed instrument like guitar, banjo and mandolin capable of playing chords.


This is a lot.

Let me know is you have any questions.
