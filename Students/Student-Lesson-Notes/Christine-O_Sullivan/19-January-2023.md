## Quarter Note Triples - Level III

Even count: 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3… No way around it – we count things using numbers.

**Level III** rhythm is where the beat is subdivided into 3 even parts per beat, counted 1 2 3. **Level II** is two parts per beat, counted 1 + 2 +, tracking two beats at a time. 

Only the downbeats, the “1” of the count, line up. This is where it gets the feeling that you're detached from the “pulse”, that typically lines up with the downbeats. Feels like you have left the ground and briefly “Rhythmically Weightless”.

```
Level III
--1---2---3---1---2---3---1---2---3---1---2---3---
  =       =       =       =       =       = 
  |           |           |           |
  |           |           |           |
--1-----+-----1-----+-----1-----+-----1-----+-----
Level II
```

In the above _text_ representation of the count for Level II and II – only the downbeats are in sync. We do perceive the upbeats in Level II, even when playing the Level III Quarter Note Triple  rhythmic syllables over top of it. The disconnect comes with the feeling of the 3 of the 1 2 3, the second quarter note of the triple late in reference to the upbeat (Level II “+”) and the third quarter of the triple on the 2 as early in reference to the downbeat.

**NOTE** – Counting is only used to learn the _sound_ of the rhythmic syllable. And, accurately reproduce it on your own.


## Universal Counting

(_excerpt from the book: Modular Phonetic Rhythm • Foundation_)

Universal counting is a (non-traditional) approach to counting rhythm. Counting has traditionally been linked to time signatures. If a piece were in common time, the count would always extend to 4 by the end of each measure. The half note for example, would be counted 1 2, or 2 3 or 3 4 depending on its location in the measure. In signatures other than common time, the variety can be even greater. In the universal counting system, a half note is always counted 1 2, regardless of its location in the measure. This concept is extended to every syllable in modular phonetics. Though some of these counts appear to duplicate from one level to another, they are unique when you factor in the subdivisions. 123 in level I is not heard or felt the same as 123 in level III.

In the long run, counting systems are relatively unimportant because, at more advanced levels, the counting is eliminated in favor of the eye - ear - hand reflex. The eye sees the rhythm, the ear hears it and the hand reflexively executes it. The closest parallel to this process is reading a language. As our knowledge of vocabulary in a language grows, we begin to recognize words, how they are pronounced and what they mean. We can achieve the exact same fluent result in reading the visual language of rhythm.

### Shift Count Exercise

Mix the following counting schemes while keeping the beat steady. All counting must be even.

```
1 2 3 4  1 2 3  1 2  1  1+2+ 123 123 
| | | |  | | |  | |  |  | |  |   |

| are the downbeats.
``` 

Here is the first line of [**All of Me** &rarr;](https://learningukulele.com/songs/code/UL218) with the count. I still do this on an passage that gives me trouble.

_Be sure to keep a steady beat. This is where a [Metronome &rarr;](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/ML13) really comes in handy._

I have a new saying I use on students. <q>I can't tell if you are counting. Only, if you should have been counting.</q>
