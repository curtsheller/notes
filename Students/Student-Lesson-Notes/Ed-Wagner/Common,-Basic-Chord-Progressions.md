# Common, Basic Chord Progressions

## iRealPro Backing tracks

Here is a [link to the iRealPro site ⇒](https://www.irealpro.com/). The app is a available for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Android. This is a great practice tool. Essentially, join the band and try your musical ideas out, and they don't even know or care about any of the clunker that you'll play.

These progressions are in C as the default. You can and should explore these and change to any other and style.

### One Chord Progressions
If a song has one chord, it's probably going to be the **Tonic** (I) chord of the key.

- [I, e.g. C](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I.html)
- [I7, e.g. C7](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I7.html)

### Two Chord Progressions Using the Primary Major Chords
If it's two chords, there is a good chance that it is these two. The Primary **Tonic** (I) and **Dominant** (V) chords in a Major Key.
- [V, e.g. C](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_V.html)
- [I V7, e.g. C](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_V7.html)
There are three primary chords in every major key/scale. The **Tonic** (I), **Sub Dominant** (IV), and the **Dominant** (V). Here is a two chord progression, using the I and IV chrods. Not as common as just two chords. But, really common with what follows next.
- [I IV, e.g. C](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_IV.html)

### Three Chord Progressions Using the Primary Major Chords
- [I IV I V, e.g. C F C G](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_IV_I_V.html)
- [I_IV_I_V7, e.g. C F C G7](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_IV_I_V7.html)

### The 50s, Doo Wop Progressions
This was the most famous progression used in the 50s.
- [I_VI_IV_V, e.g. C Am F G](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_VI_IV_V.html)
- - [I VI IV V7, e.g. C Am F G7](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_VI_IV_V7.html)
- [I_VI_II_V7, e.g. C Am Dm G7](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_VI_II_V7.html)
- [Imaj7_VIm7_IIm7_V7 Cmaj7 Am7 Dm7 G7](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/Imaj7_VIm7_IIm7_V7.html)

### The Famous 4-Chord Pop Progression

This is a spin on the 50s I VI IV V and I VI II V progression above. And, is the most common progression currently in use.
