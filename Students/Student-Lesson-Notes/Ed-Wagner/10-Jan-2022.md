# Johnny B Goode Intro

Straight out of the Blues and Major Pentonic chords and a lot of chord tones.

```
|-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-|-5---------------|-----------------|
|-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-|-5-8-7-5---------|-----------------|
|---------------------|---------5-6-----|-----------------|
|---------------------|-------------7---|-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-|
|---------------------|---------------7-|-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-|
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
```

Notice the E and A of the starting lick is bookmarked with the
E and A at in m.3 

I remember this is sitting all right in the A barre chord at frets (5).

```
|-----------------|---
|---5-7-5---------|-- Then the crazy bending of
|-6---6---4-2---2-|---of D on string up a whole step to E,
|-------------4---|---matvhing the E on string 2.
|-----------------|---This goes on for two measure then
|-----------------|-- Bles/Pent to the beginning of the song
```


NOTES: This is a *12 bar blues* with the original recording in **Bb** major.


# Super Blues

eg.: A B C C# D D#(Eb) E F# G A.

Best way to think of these and use the notes of this scale is to add notes on one scale to the other when you are using is.

**A Blues**: A C D D#(Eb) G A. Add **C#** and **F#** when on on the A chord. Add **F#** when on the G chrod. When on he E/E7 add G# wich is a chord tone in E,E7 and not in either the A BLues or A Pentatonic scale. So, adding chord tones of the chord that are not in the chord is always OK and a way of expanding the scale. Which also means being away if the nbotes that are inte chord.
