# Super Blues

Mixed Blues and Major Pentatonic

eg.: **A B C C# D D#(Eb) E F# G A**.

Best way to think of these and use the notes of this scale is to add notes on one scale to the other when you are using is.

**A Blues** (Minor Pentatonic): A C D D#(Eb) G A. Add **C#** and **F#** when on on the A chord. Add **F#** when on the G chord. When on he E/E7 add G# wich is a chord tone in E,E7 and not in either the A Blues or A Pentatonic scale. So, adding chord tones of the chord that are not in the chord is always OK and a way of expanding the scale. Which also means being away if the nbotes that are inte chord.

**A Pentantonic**: A B C C# E F# A'. Add C to A Pentontic is "Bluesify" the major sound sounding scale. Add "G".
