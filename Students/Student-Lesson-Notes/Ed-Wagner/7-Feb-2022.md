# Connectinting Positions

Second step after memprizing and exploring the five overlapping position for a scale on the guitar fingerboard. Is to connect and explore teh varions possible pathways through a scale and connecting the various positions.

```
Fingers:
   3  1  3  1  1  3  1  3  1  3  3  2  4
|------------------------------------------|
|-----------------------------------8--10--|
|--------------------------5--7--9---------|
|--------------------5--7------------------|
|--------------5--7------------------------|
|-----3--5--7------------------------------|
|--5---------------------------------------|
```

- The examples above uses a sliding of finger three.
- Alternately you can slide finger one vs.three.

Which finger you use depends on personal preference if thre is not musical reason to use one finger vs. another.

Musically, when doing a slide (*glissando*) or a hemmer-on or pull-off. For the three notes on one string you can hammer-on then slide. For a pull-off, perform the pull-off then slide.
