# Blues Licks and Fills

The **Blues** and **Pentatonic** is scales are a great place to grab licks and riffs from.

- **Blues and Pentatonic Scales**
	- E Blues on the I, IV and V chords
	- E Pentatonic, Mixolydian on A, E5, E7, etc.
	- A Pentatonic, Mixolydian on A, A5, A7, etc.
	- B Pentatonic, Mixolydian on B, B5, B7, etc.

Triads are great for fills and licks.

- On **E** use A G and D trids as fills. Think as if they are horn sections and stabbing licks.
