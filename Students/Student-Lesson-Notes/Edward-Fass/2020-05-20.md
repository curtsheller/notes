# Alterted Scale

There are a lot of "Altered" scales available that players have traditionally used, especially over 7th chords. Some starting on different intervals of the chord. 

Most of these are really just a way to organize the possibilities over a given chord. I'm a firm believer of basing all your vertical scale choices based on the root of the chord.

Simply think of the basic, 1st choice scale for that chord and what alterations you want to include.

For 7th chords: -2 +2 +4/-5 +5 are pretty much it, given the 3rd and b7th are color tones and need for to establish the chord.


This can also be used when doing a scale that cover multiple chord in a tonal center: i.e. C Am F or Dm G7 to C. On the G7 add the alterations.

# 3 to b9

This is a cool, hip, common jazz move.


```
 C7                        Fmaj7
--------------------4--3-----|-----------|-------
--------------------------6--|--5--------|-------
--------------3--4-----------|-----------|-------
-----3--5--6-----------------|-----------|-------
Int: b7 R  -2 +2 3 -9  R  b7    3
```

It comes down to timing ad getting in your ideas in the allotted time. Too early to target, play more, too late, squeeze it in.


# Phrased Melodies

Simply rephrasing the melody, rhythmically, is a great start to developing a solo. Adding diatonic and chromatic passing tones, etc...
