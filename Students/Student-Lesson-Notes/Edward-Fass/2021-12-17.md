	- Upper Partials and Chord Extensions 
	- Chord Alterations: b5, #5, b9, #9, #11, b13 on 7th chords only, #11 on maj7.


## Common Progressions: II V I VI

Example: **Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 C6**, **Gm7** **C7** **Fmaj7 F6**

**Use Voice Leading**

In basic triads this is **Dm G C**. With G7 a common sub for G.

The first 4-part chord to be used extensively with triads was the 7th on the V, Dominant chord.

### Partial 4-part Chords
You can easily make a triad a partial 4-part chord by lowering the root the approporiate number of steps to get the major or minor seventh.

Explore these in the *common keys* of: 

- **C G D A E**, the rock, folk, country, pop, bluegrass, etc keys
- **C F Bb Eb Ab Db G**, the "Jazz" keys. 

For ukulele I would put the key of F with the C G D A and E common keys.
