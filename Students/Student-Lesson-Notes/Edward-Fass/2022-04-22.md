## Target Notes

Take a simple chord progressions and using a scale that works over the chords. Play the scale and target, stress single notes. Really listening for how that particular notes sounds against the current chords


## Chord Tones

**Chord Tones** are guaranteed to sound great against their chord.

- Craft a line using the chord tones and connect to the closest chord tone on the next chord.
- Target the ninth or second of each chord on a line.

### Triads plus one.

- The second as he plus one for maj and seventh chords always sound good
- The fourth as the plus one for minor chords always sound good.

Connect target using scale runs, intervals, arpeggios, and sequences.
