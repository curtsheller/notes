## Mixolydian -2 -6

As the name has the directions in it, the mix -2-6 is: 1 b2 3 4 5 b6 b7 8. A very exotic sound. 

It is used on Seventh chord resolving up a perfect fourth or down a perfect fifth to a minor chord. In thi sontext it is a very traditional sounding scale.

Expanding this to its II chord you have a **II V I** in a minor key or harmonic cell, eg, **Gm7b5 C7 Fm7**

For a more modern shound I use a Locrian of the root of the II chord.

The Seventh chrod is the chord, typically used as some type of dominant that can take the most alteration in the chrod or the scale used to solo over it.
