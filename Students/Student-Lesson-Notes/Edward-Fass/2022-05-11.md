## Scale Choices
1. Vertical, scale per chord, based on the root.
2. Tonal Centers - Harmonic Analysis (HA)


### Inside/Outside

- **Inside**, within the current chord and scale.
- **Outside**, Any notes no in the current tonality (chord, first choice scale)

## Melodic Tricks

In addition to all the standard, traditional melodic devices that one can use. A few, "Jazz" ones we can do are:

- Repeat the motif just played up a half step and then resolve back to the motif back to the origainal.
- Do the motif up a tritone then, agan from the octave.
- The Harmonized Chord Scale as triads is always a good move like we covered in past lessons.

Way this kinds of stuff works is the resoution back tot he tones ("Inside") that you came from.
