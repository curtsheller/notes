# Notes of the Ukulele Fingerboard

- What Tuning?
	- Vertical
		- Keys Frets (open), (5), (7)
		- Secondary Frets (2), (10)
		- And, (4), (9)
	- Horizontal
		- Natural Letters: A B C D E F G (A..) &bull; Along each single string. Starting on the open string.

The Ultimate goal is, given two of these three: the note name, the string number, and/or the fret number. You can name the remaining missing item: e.g., in C Tuning:
1. G on String one is\_\_\_\_\_?, FRET
2. String three, fret (7) is \_\_\_\_\_? NAME
3. G on fret (3) is on String \_\_\_\_\_?. STRING

## Other Drills

- Random shapoes and name the notes.
- Find ever \_\_\_\_\_?, Pick any natural, sharp or flat note and find all of them.
- Close your eyes and out your finger on the ukulele, open your eyes and name the note.

These are but a few of the many drills you can do. **YOU CAN NOT KNOW THE NOTES OF THE UKULELE FINGERBOARD IN YOUR HOME TUNING TOO WELL!**
