# Noise Suppression

Noise Suppression level is meant to take out ambient background noise, such as the fan in the background, your furnace firing up, or someone driving their car past the house.

Start at -10 dB, and lower it until your mic isn’t picking up any more ambient noise. Once you’ve found a spot where your mic isn’t picking up any noise from your room, stop.
