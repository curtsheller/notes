# Mic Placement


The right distance from your mouth will vary from mic-to-mic, start with around five inches away from my mouth. A boom arm can help with placement. If too far away, the mic will pick up any echo in the room. If too close, your voice will have an unnatural amount of bass to it and possible distortion of your sound when you make plosive sounds. Find a range that minimizes both issues.
