Dynamic range can be defined as the ratio between the loudest possible audio level and the lowest possible level.


Dialogue Ducking. This is probably the most well-known compressor side-chaining application. Consider a common House-of-Worship situation where the pastor is leading a meditation while the piano or pre-recorded music is being played. Apply a compressor on the stereo music track with a fairly low threshold, high ratio, a fast attack and a long release time, using the pastor’s microphone channel as the key source for the compressor. Now the compressor will react to level fluctuations from the pastor’s microphone, allowing the music to naturally rise and fall in counterpoint to the speech pattern.
