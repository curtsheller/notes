## How I customize my Mac terminal with open source tools

- Use [**iTerm2**, **Oh My Zsh**, and **Powerlevel10k**](https://opensource.com/article/20/8/iterm2-zsh?utm_campaign=intrel) to create a terminal built for productivity.


## Linux

### GNOME Terminal

If you're on Linux, the default terminals (such as GNOME terminal, Konsole, XFCE terminal, or similar) match or exceed the features of iTerm2, so you can use whatever you already have installed.
