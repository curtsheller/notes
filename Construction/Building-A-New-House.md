# Building A New House

- Install a secret passageway, so that you may move from one room to another through the closets or otherwise.
- Place closets, bookshelves and similar appurtenances on outside walls for the added insulating effect.
- Incorporate solar for production of electricity.
- Rely on stored LPG for cooking, hot water and heating.
- Install a gas operated generator for emergency power to supply refrigeration, sparking for the gas water heater, laundry appliances, a single outlet (marked) in each room, and water pump if you use a well.
- In areas where many outlets may be required, install plug mold (continuous strips of outlets). Alternate the feed of each outlet to use a different electrical circuit from the panel.
- Place the laundry area in the living area, not the basement.
- Run cables for data/TV/audio to every room.
- Use 6â€³ studding everywhere except inside partitions within a room. Might already be code in your location.
- Bury heating elements under outside walkways to melt off snow and ice.
- Use proximity detectors to activate room lights.
