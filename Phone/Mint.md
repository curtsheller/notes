Need to cancel number transfer (port transfer). Mint seems to have picked up previous number 484-943-8041 (I thought cancelled with previous Mint tech call). Really need this resolved, cancelled, so I can start over with the right number. I've been through 2 Mint tech calls with three different people, and it is sill NOT resolved.

Need port transfer request for 484-943-8041 cancelled/removed for my Mint acct:(484) 944-2519 (temp number) . It was a typo and I need to start over with the right number. This is the third attempt with Mint tech to get this resolved. The Mint mobile app is showing "Number transfer pending" with the wrong number (484-943-8041)

Current Mint temp number: (484) 944-2519
