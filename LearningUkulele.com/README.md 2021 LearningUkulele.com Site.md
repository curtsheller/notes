# 2021 LearningUkulele.com Site

Using Laravel 8 as the starting point and Laravel Fortify for the 2021 version of LearningUkulele.com web application.

## Goals

*See the Joplin application for the TO DO list all that is needed. This is a general overview of what is involved.*

 
- [ ] Clean up views and Vue.
- [ ] Laravel 8, which LearningUkulele.com is already using.
- [ ]  Tailwind CSS 2.0 and Laravel Mix 6. This dev site is using TaiwindCSS 2, Laravel 8 and Learvel Mix 5. LearningUkulele.com 2020 is on tailwindcss 1.9.0. Need to move everything over from the 2020 site and major clean-up on the way.
- [ ]  Replace <strike>Algolia</strike> with **MeiliSearch**. Using it live and it seems to be going pretty good. Just need to figure it out before the next Algolia payment is takeen out. MeiliSearch server is at search.curtsheller-ve.com on DigitalOcean and I need to set it up to notife me if it goes down.
