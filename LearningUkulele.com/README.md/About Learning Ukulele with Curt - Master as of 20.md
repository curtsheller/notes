This is a **private** *repro* for the LearningUkulele.com web site. Using Laravel 8.

## All Things Ukulele and Curt Sheller

**No Tricks** &bull; **No Secrets** &bull; **No Shortcuts** &bull; **Nothing for Dummies** â€” and you're NOT going to learn the ukulele in 7 days or 30 days or even master it in your lifetime. You just enjoy the ride, explore, and have a lifetime of fun!

## TODO


## MeiliSearch

- Update date to lastest version.

- There should not be o (zero) entries for Main Instrument or Main Categories.

- Create scripts to automate MeliSearch *flushing* and *updating* to assets.

- **Songs** has a bogus access status of 'Ppremiu' that needs cleaned up. Seems to be in the MeiliSearch instance but not the site database. Also, 'Hormpipe' has no tagged songs.

- Spun up a DigitalOcean MeiliSearch server via forge (search.learningukulele.com). Still using the search.curtsheller-dev.com server till I do more testing with the `forge` managed server. Maybe 2022.
