## Learning Ukulele with Curt
**The World’s Most Comprehensive Ukulele Site**

On the web since the early 1990’s,  published my first book in 2000. First ukulele books in 2003. Started attending festivals, performing and presenting workshops.

- No Tricks * No Secrets * No Shortcuts * Nothing for Dummies, … 

**Proven Methods** - If there’s one thing that I’ve learned over 30 plus years of SERIOUS study, research and application — as well as from my weekly interaction with the 50 to 60 students each and every week. — *It’s that everyone is different*. I can adapt to pretty much anything and have a multitude of ways of teaching any given topic. I **CAN** find what works for you - that’ is my role in this and goal to help you learn and develop your voice on the ukulele.

The only guarantee I can make with my methods and guidance is — *if you put the time and work in you WILL get results*. I’ve put the time in and have been down all the same roads that your starting to go down.

One thing that I’ve found over the years is that **EVERY** musician you admire probably started right where you and I started.

- Calvin Coolidge
- Mark Twain
