# Double Chromatic Scale

There are 2 scale patterns in common use.

#1) C Db D# E F G A Bb C

#2) C D E F Gb G# A Bb C

As you can see, both scales carry the 3 critical notes for the C7 chord. These notes are the root, third and flat 7th notes of a C7 chord (C E Bb).

Each scale can be used against a C7 chord.

If the chord is an altered chord such as C7b9 or C7#9, use scale #1

Scale #1 includes the b9 and #9.

If the chord is an altered chord such as C7b5 or C7#5, use scale #2.

Scale #2 includes the b5 and #5.
