# How Long Does It Take To Learn Ukulele?

For playing basic chords and simple strumming patterns, the ukulele is relatively easy, and one can accomplish this is a relatively short period of time.

To go beyond the basics — it’s like almost any other instrument. It simply takes time and with the right approach and guidance you can skip some speed bumps and errors that happen when you go it alone.

Here is what my mentor and whom I studied with for many, many years said about /Going it Alone/. And I totally agree with.

/*“An objective assessment of the two alternative approaches leads me (Chuck Anderson) invariably towards the formal route. Why? Because without guidance, there is a tendency to go in circles, What do you practice, when do you move to the next topic? When are you doing something wrong? How do you practice what doesn’t exist to you?”*/ — *Chuck Anderson*
