I began playing guitar at age nine. Since 1978, I have been a serious student of jazz guitar.  I had the great privilege and honor of studying with Chuck Anderson for more than 30 years.  He’s one of the most knowledge musicians I’ve known.  With his guidance, I focused on jazz and contemporary guitar. With him, no subject was off limits. Topics including arranging, private teaching, 20th century harmony, performing and working with other musicians, and anything that came up we covered in the lessons.  

In the summer of 2003, I fell in love with the ukulele and all its possibilities. The ukulele has been the center of my energy ever since then.  My journey exploring the ukulele began by accident on a CampFire USA trip to South Dakota planned by my wife, Bernadette.  I’d searched the Internet for a small travel guitar to bring with me, and rediscovered the ukulele instead. I began pursuing the potential of the ukulele. Researching the field, I realized that there was very little material on the ukulele appropriate for intermediate and advanced players.  At that time, I had substantial understanding of music and guitar that I could apply to the ukulele.  So, I methodically began to develop detailed lessons and write books for ukulele players, drawing on my knowledge and experience of playing jazz and contemporary guitar and studying with Chuck Anderson.  For the last several years, I brought a ukulele instead of a guitar to my lessons with Chuck.  Chuck also helped me by reviewing and editing my books and online lesson material. 

I have developed an international reputation as an ukulele expert, having written 30 some book for and more than 600, approaching 700 lessons for the ukulele and more than 10 books for guitar.  Visit my website at  [www.LearningUkulele.com](http://www.learningukulele.com/)  to see my work as an author and educator.  I conduct ukulele workshops and along with my wife Bernadette and daughter Kelly run an annual ukulele festival entitled Funky Frets Uke Fest to great acclaim. I remain a professional musician.  I recently released a jazz ukulele CD, “How About More Uke?”, exploring the ukulele with traditional and contemporary jazz repertoire and some my original music, all of which showcase a nontraditional ukulele performance.  Chuck Anderson was a valuable asset leading up to the recording of our CD with his help whipping the charts into shape and allowing us to record his great song Rain Shine.  I also continue to perform live concerts. With my wife Bernadette and daughter Kelly we own the Funky Frets music store in Boyertown, PA, where we sell ukuleles and I conduct music lessons. I also teach via Skype.


## Keys to Success

* The key to success in any field is, to a large extent, really as simple as doing quality exploration repetitiously. 

* Stick with anything long enough and you tend to get good at it. With guidance from the right teacher and mentors and you can get really good.

## Reviews and Comments

* Curt, I really enjoyed your set at The Whiskey - your low-key intros, mic persona provided a cool contrast with your complex uke technique and ingenious arrangements! - Best wishes, - *Jared Denhard*

* Curt, your CD was fantastic. You are amongst the ukulele masters of our day. - *John K.*


* Just browsing over both books, they look fantastic! I’m a guitarist and uke player for over 25 years and was thinking about writing a ukulele book but you’ve already written what I think are the best, most comprehensive and thorough books I’ve ever seen for the instrument. I just might end up buying every book you’ve written and I’ll be giving my highest recommendation for your books to my friends and students. Thank you so much for taking the time to write such great books! — *Peter Rhee*

* Curt Sheller is probably the most published person on the planet for intermediate and advanced ukulele publications. His instruction manuals and training materials are the most extensive in advanced concepts of blues and improvisational jazz on the ukulele. His works include “Advanced Guide to Chord Progressions for Ukulele”, “Exploring Jazz Chords on Ukulele”, “QuickStart Arpeggio Fingerings for Ukulele” just to name a few. - *Windy City Uke Festival*

* Your chord of the week lessons are great! Really opened my eyes as to what I was doing & has allowed me to figure out the best way to play the chords I need, depending on the arrangement. Ive actually only looked at the first 2 weeks so far, then worked out the 3rd week myself.  I especially like the way that each week builds on what was learned the previous, so you are incorporating all the forms into the exercises! - *  visitor* [LearningUkulele.com](http://LearningUkulele.com) 

* “Just received your newest CD. I have listened to it three times now and, as a result have moved you into that group of excellent uke players I especially admire and know that I can learn a great deal from by listening repeatedly to their stylings (not to mention enjoying their fabulous ukulele music).” - *Andy Andrews* / /founder of Ukulele Club of Santa Cruz & the Puna Ukulele & Kanikapila Association/
