Bio
I began playing guitar at age nine. Since 1978, I have been a serious student of jazz guitar.  I had the great privilege and honor of studying with Chuck Anderson for more than 30 years.  He’s one of the most knowledge musicians I’ve known.  With his guidance, I focused on jazz and contemporary guitar. With him, no subject was off limits. Topics including arranging, private teaching, 20th century harmony, performing and working with other musicians, and anything that came up we covered in the lessons.  I started with a half-hour lesson and quickly went to a one-hour lesson a week to ultimately two-hours a week of private study with Chuck. Yes!!!, he is that good.




Ukulele
In the summer of 2003, I fell in love with the ukulele and all its possibilities. The ukulele has been the center of my energy ever since then.  My journey exploring the ukulele began accidentally on a Campfire USA trip to South Dakota planned by my wife, Bernadette.  I’d searched the Internet for a small travel guitar to bring with me, and rediscovered the ukulele instead. I began pursuing the potential of the ukulele. Researching the field, I realized that there was very little material on the ukulele appropriate for intermediate and advanced players.  At that time, I had a substantial understanding of music and guitar that I could apply to the ukulele.  So, I methodically began to develop detailed lessons and write books for ukulele players, drawing on my knowledge and experience of playing jazz and contemporary guitar and studying with Chuck Anderson.  For the last several years, I brought a ukulele instead of a guitar to my lessons with Chuck.  Chuck also helped me by reviewing and editing my books and on-line lesson material.


I have developed an international reputation as a ukulele expert, having written 30 some book for and more than 600, approaching 700 lessons for the ukulele and more than 10 books for guitar.  Visit my website at  [www.LearningUkulele.com](http://www.learningukulele.com/)  to see my work as an author and educator.  I conduct ukulele workshops and along with my wife Bernadette and daughter Kelly run an annual ukulele festival entitled Funky Frets Uke Fest to great acclaim. I remain a professional musician.  I recently released a jazz ukulele CD, “How About More Uke?”, exploring the ukulele with traditional and contemporary jazz repertoire and my original music, all of which showcase a nontraditional ukulele performance.  Chuck Anderson was an asset leading up to the recording of our CD with his help to whip the charts into shape and allowing us to record his great song Rain Shine.  I also continue to perform live concerts. With my wife Bernadette and daughter Kelly, we own the Funky Frets music store in Boyertown, PA, where we sell ukuleles and I conduct music lessons. I also teach via Skype.


# Do You Need Talent?
[Learning Ukulele with Curt • The Top Fundamental Things for Learning Ukulele](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/learning)


Since it is so difficult to define or even recognize, talent, or the lack of it, has created more than its share of anxiety in aspiring musicians. Perhaps the greatest problem centers around the fact that *talent is a fact in retrospect*. Only after it has been developed does it become obvious that it exists. So, how does one know that talent is within him? Is intuition or hope the only recourse? Though there is no way to prove the existence of talent or at least the degree of talent before the fact, there are some general indicators.


* Unusual Determination in the Face of Difficulties and Setbacks
* Consistent Search to Know
* Awareness of the relationship involving current obligations, accomplishments and goals
* Surge
* Commitment to goals
* Proper sense of ego


Since talent remains a question mark in the developmental phases, doubts are understandable. The time required to develop instrumental proficiency, knowledge, maturity and the freedom to express oneself is slow and often tedious. It is necessary to allow this time to evolve before talent can even be considered. There is one very common fear. What if after physical and intellectual abilities are developed there is no talent or what if it is not great enough? The matter is at best highly subjective. Who decides upon talent? One fact emerges clearly - that which exists within you is uniquely yours. Thus, you strive forward to develop your potential. As it develops, call it talent. If it is not necessary for you to label it — merely accept it. There is no need to identify or categorize it. No one is responsible for the potential within him. The individual is responsible for the development of his own potential, and then only if he accepts the challenge and the importance of developing it.
