# Printing on Laser Printers
Get off-white or ivory paper—pure white tends to highlight flaws in the laser printing. Choose wove paper, which is smooth, rather than laid paper, which has a varied texture. Laser toner affixes better to a smooth surface.
Compared to black printing ink, black laser toner has a characteristic luster and is usually closer to dark gray than black. Heighten the illusion by printing the name and address in a color—something pale and noncontroversial. Color laser printers also use process color, so run tests to make sure the color you pick doesn’t have a gritty dot pattern. Grayish-blue tones often work well.
