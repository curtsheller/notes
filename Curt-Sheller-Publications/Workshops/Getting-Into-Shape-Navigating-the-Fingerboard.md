# Getting Into Ukulele Shape

## Navigating the Ukulele Fingerboard

Learn the six fingering principles for navigating the ukulele fingerboard.

Fingering is one of the most universal topics. Whether your style is Rock, Blues, Country, Jazz or Classical, these principles will improve your technique, your solos, even your sight-reading. Think of fingering as a series of pathways. When you learn to connect these pathways, there are benefits not only to technique but also to creativity. All fingering on the ukulele can be reduced to 6 principles of motion. Each principle has physical and musical characteristics that you can use to improve your playing.

This weekly series of lessons/workshops will guide you through, *finally* learning the ukulele fingerboard and developing technique and skill set to navigate the various pathways through any musical passage.

After a brief introduction and setting a foundation for exploring the fingerboard, we'll guide you through each of the six fingering principles using a series of drill, exercises, finger gymnastics to cover the technical side of getting your hands to follow your musical ear. Then apply these skills and knowledge to single note and harmonized lines, melodies, licks, riffs ALL over the ukulele fingerboard.Â Actually using all this to create or interpert the music your working on.

This is a 10 to 12 week series of one hour lessons.

Followed by shorter daily videos for demonstrating the exercises and drills. The sessions wil also include Q&A of any issues you might be having with the weeks goals.
