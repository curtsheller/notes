## Learning the Notes of the Ukulele Fingerboard

This is not learning to read, although it's a requirement if one of the goals is to learn to read music. It's simply knowing the possible names of each fret on each string. Without this you are guaranteed to struggle applying what you learn beyond the basics.

### Seven Letters, Twelve Notes

This and a few of the principles of music are all that you need. For starters is simply knowing that music, for English speaker uses the first seven letters of the standard alphabet to name the notes in one octave scales and your chords. These are letters are: A B D C E F G. The then it simply repeats starting over with A. Arrange these  in a circle, and you can start on any letter and go either clockwise or counterclockwise.

#### The Twelve (12) Notes of the Chromatic Scale

If you start in the "A" string, the string closest to your toes or floor when seated or standing. The twelve (12) notes of the "Chromatic Scale", ascending in one octave are: A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#. As with the seven letters it starts over at A. One of the first things I noticed was there is not a sharp between B and C, not a sharp between E and  F. E Sharp is the same pitch as F and B sharp is the same pitch as C. E# and F as well as B# and C are called "Enharmonic Equivalents" — the same pitch but different note names and symbols when notated in "Standard Music Notation."

Descending the "Chromatic Scale" would utilize the flat notation for: A Ab G Gb F E Eb D Db C B Bb. And as with the "Chromatic Scale" utilizing the natural note names and sharp note names. Again B C and E F have no flat notes between them.

Assignment: Memorize A B C D E F G and the Chromatic Scale both ascending and descending. 

Ascending: A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#
Descending: A Ab G Gb F E Eb D Db C B Bb

The Piano keyboard is a great way to visualize the relationship between the notes and the "Enharmonic Equivalents". View the LearningUkulele.com lesson: [`Ukulele • Piano Comparison](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/UL07-piano).

The Piano, as it's typically a fixed/set tuning is color coded for better note recognition. The Ukulele, as it can be tuned however you like can't really do that. And the fact that on piano, within one octave you can only play a given note in one location. The Ukulele, as with the guitar has "Alternate Note Locations" — the ability to play the same note at multiple locations. See the lesson: [Tune-Up! Tuning Your Ukulele](https://learningukulele.com/tuneup) that shows how to tune using the open string one - A as a reference note to tune all the other strings. In a Re-entrant C Tuning that has string four as a high "G" note. This "A" is ALL then same pitch. 

Granted, it seems like an overwhelming task to memorize the ukulele fingerboard. However, it's one of the areas, to use a corporate term ROI, your "Return On Investment" is far greater than the effort that you put in to it. I guarantee you see the benefit as we move along with this series. 

For starters, I found that memorizing three frets can give you over 50% of the fingerboard. You might say my math is off with 3 oust of 12 not equalling 50% - but, throgh in the next higher, sharp frets for FREE and the previous lower flat frets for FREE, and it is over 50% from just learning three frets. And, "drum-roll", those three frets are: the open strings, fret (and frets (7).

Open Strings: G C E A
Fret (5): C F A D
Fret (7): D G B E
Sharp and flat each fret, and you have the open strings as well as frets (1) (4) (%) (6) (7) (8) and (11) as frets (12) is the same names as the open strings.
