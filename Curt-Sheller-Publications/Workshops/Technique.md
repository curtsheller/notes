## Technique

“You'll never be any better than your physical ability, your hand's ability to execute what your musical ear and mind have planned.” You can hear it, now you want your hands to do it.

Our "Musical Ear", which has been developing sincel we were a toddler is always a bit to far behind around hands abaility the execute what are brand and musical ear what.

**Musical Technique** is simply the physical aspect of playing a musical instrument. The ability to exert efficient, optimal control to produce the precise musical effects that are desired. Improving one's technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve one's muscular sensitivity and agility. Technique is independent of musicality.


We can use the analogy of running. We've all done it, we know what’s involved - but, if your goal is to run a marathon you have to put in the work first. You have to plan, set short-term goals and execute what is needed to achieve those goals. The same holds true for learning the ukulele. It involves the mind, hands and ear. The ear and mind part are relatively easy. It's the hands where all the work is. And, just as we can take advantage and benefit from what an Olympic marathoner knows, we can benefit from the knowledge a virtuoso musician knows.

## Both Hands

Both hands are involved in getting the music out through your ukulele.
