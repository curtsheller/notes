## Contemporary

- **sus** - The term is borrowed from the [contrapuntal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint)  technique of [suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonchord_tone#Suspension) , where a note from a previous chord is carried over to the next chord, and then [resolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(music)) down to the third or tonic, *suspending* a note from the previous chord.
