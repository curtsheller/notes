# Main Branches of Unix

Contemporary Unix implementations differ in whether they're open source (i.e., free to download, use or modify) or closed source (i.e., proprietary binary files not subject to user modification).


- Minix—a Unix-like open-source project, rarely used by home users.
- Linux—an open-source initiative to bring a Unix-like environment to both the desktop and server space; Linux is popular with home computer enthusiasts.
- Mac OS X—Apple's desktop operating system. Kernel is called Darwin and is Open Source.
T- he BSDs (FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)—a branch-off from the earliest Unix specs, following the design principles of the Berkeley Software Distribution.
- AIX—a series of Unix-based operating environments developed by IBM for its servers.
- Solaris—a proprietary server operating system, based on Unix, developed by Sun Microsystems
- OpenSolaris—an open-source variant of Solaris.
- HP-UX—a series of Unix-based operating environments developed by HP for its servers.
