# SQLite

**SQLite** is a relational database management system (RDBMS) contained in a C library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program.

SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen().
