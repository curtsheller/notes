# Backup

## Déjà Dup Backups

A trivial-to-use personal backup tool to protect against accidental data loss.

The software hides the complexity of doing backups the ‘right way’ (encrypted, off-site, and regular). It is a frontend for Duplicity (which uses the rsync library and gpg keys for encryption) written in Vala.
