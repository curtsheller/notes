# Chords

( _Notes with my comments from Wikipedia )_

**Tertian** chords can be decomposed into a series of (major or minor) thirds. For example, the C major triad (C–E–G) is defined by a sequence of two intervals, the first (C–E) being a major third and the second (E–G) being a minor third. Most common chords are tertian.

**Secundal** chords can be decomposed into a series of (major or minor) seconds. For example, the chord C–D–E♭ is a series of seconds, containing a major second (C–D) and a minor second (D–E♭).

**Quartal** chords can be decomposed into a series of (perfect or augmented) fourths. Quartal harmony normally works with a combination of perfect and augmented fourths. Diminished fourths are enharmonically equivalent to major thirds, so they are uncommon.[33] For example, the chord C–F–B is a series of fourths, containing a perfect fourth (C–F) and an augmented fourth/tritone (F–B).

**Secundal**    built using intervals of a major and/or minor _seconds_ 
**Tertian**     built using intervals of a major and/or minor _thirds_  
**Quartal**     built using intervals of a perfect and/or augmented _fourths_  
**Quintal**     built using intervals of a perfect and/or augmented _fifths_

# Chord Symbols

    - m, min, or − indicates a minor chord. The "m" must be lowercase to distinguish it from the "M" for major.
    - **M**, Ma, Maj, Δ, or (no symbol) indicates a major chord. In a jazz context, this typically indicates that the player should use any suitable chord of a major quality, for example a major seventh chord or a 6/9 chord. In a lot of jazz styles, an unembellished major triad is rarely if ever played, but in a lead sheet the choice of which major quality chord to use is left to the performer.
    - + or aug indicates an augmented chord (A or a is not used).
    - o or dim indicates a diminished chord, either a diminished triad or a diminished seventh chord (d is not used).
    - ø indicates a half-diminished seventh chord. In some fake books, the abbreviation m7(♭5) is used as an equivalent symbol.
    - 2 is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g., add2, sus2).
    - 3 is the minor or major quality of the chord and is rarely written as a number.
    - 4 is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g., add4, sus4).
    - 5 is the (perfect) fifth of the chord and is only written as a number when altered (e.g., F7(♭5)). In guitar music, like rock, a "5" indicates a power chord, which consists of only the root and fifth, possibly with the root doubled an octave higher.
    - 6 indicates a sixth chord. There are no rules if the 6 replaces the 5th or not.
    - 7 indicates a dominant seventh chord. However, if Maj7, M7 or Δ7 is indicated, this is a major 7th chord (e.g., GM7 or FΔ7). Very rarely, also dom is used for dominant 7th.
    - 9 indicates a ninth chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh as well, if it is a dominant chord.
    - 11 indicates an eleventh chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh and ninth as well, if it is a dominant chord.
    - 13 indicates a thirteenth chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh, ninth and eleventh as well.
    - 6/9 indicates a triad with the addition of the sixth and ninth.
    - sus4 (or simply 4) indicates a sus chord with the third omitted and the fourth used instead. Other notes may be added to a sus4 chord, indicated with the word "add" and the scale degree (e.g., Asus4(add9) or Asus4(add7)). Traditional sus only apoplied the suspension of the fouth to the third.
    - sus2 (or simply 2) indicates a sus chord with the third omitted and the second (which may also be called the ninth) used instead. As with "sus4", a "sus2" chord can have other scale degrees added (e.g., Asus2(add♭7) or Asus2(add4)).
    - (♭9) (parenthesis) is used to indicate explicit chord alterations (e.g., A7(♭9)). The parenthesis is probably left from older days when jazz musicians weren't used to "altered chords". Albeit important, the parenthesis can be left unplayed (with no "musical harm").
    - add indicates that an additional interval number should be added to the chord. (e.g., C7add13 is a C 7th chord plus an added 13th).
    - alt or alt dom indicates an altered dominant seventh chord (e.g., G7♯11).
    - omit5 (or simply no5) indicates that the (indicated) note should be omitted.

# Notation
Chord letters, sometimes used in modern musicology, to denote chord root and quality. Chord _qualities_ are related to the qualities of the component intervals that define the chord. The main chord qualities are: 

    - Major and minor
    - Augmented, diminished, and half-diminished
    - Dominant

## Dominant

In music theory, a dominant seventh chord, or major minor seventh chord, is a seventh chord, usually built on the fifth degree of the major scale, and composed of a root, major third, perfect fifth, and minor seventh. Thus it is a major triad together with a minor seventh, denoted by the letter name of the chord root and a superscript "7". An example is the dominant seventh chord built on G, written as G7, having pitches G–B–D–F: 

This more of a _function_ vs. a quality or chord type. Dominant, if used in the "chord name", should be a seventh chord actually functioning as a "Dominant" chord in the tonality.

## Borrowed Chords

A borrowed chord is one from a different key than the home key, the key of the piece it is used in. The most common occurrence of this is where a chord from the parallel major or minor key is used.
