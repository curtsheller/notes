At first we were strictly a harmonica company. **Bushman Music Works** began on January 3, 1996 armed only with a basic website on the just-becoming-popular internet, a small garage with some harmonicas in it, a tape gun, a shipping table and some small boxes. We sold the Hohner Marine Band harmonica for $13.50. In 1997 we began attending blues festivals like the King Biscuit, and harmonica conventions like SPAH and Buckeye (a fun harmonica event that used to be held in Columbus, OH). Weâ€™d set-up a card table, stack some harmonicas on it, and start selling!
