# Chords of the Major Scale

Memorize this Mantra.

* TRIADS: **maj** **mi** **mi** **mi** **maj** **maj** **mi** **dim**
* 4-Part: **maj7** **m7** **m7** **m7** **maj7** **7** **mi7** **m7b5**

This is how I can get the chords for any scale. Too much to memorize otherwise.

### Chord Spelling

I've added the Alternate Chord Spelling lessons to your assets.

NOTE: The best method is to use the Major scale and the chord's "Numeric Chord Formula" for spelling chords.
