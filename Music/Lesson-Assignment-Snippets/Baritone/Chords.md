## Learning Chords

Typically, ones first learns the basic, open position chords, common chords in the common keys. Then the movable forms of those open position chords, then 4-part, contemporary chords commonly called “Jazz” chords. These three all have a system that organizes these efficiently to learn and use them. Then finally it is “Free Form:” chords. These Free Form chords are when you know how chords are constructed, and you know the notes of the fingerboard and can create the chords using that available knowledge.

1. **Open Position Chords** - Picking a song or two will dictate the chords to learn. TO cover the primary chords in the common major keys use the progressions below.
