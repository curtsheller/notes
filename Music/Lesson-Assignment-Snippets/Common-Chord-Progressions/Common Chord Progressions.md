The **Simple**, **Three Chord**, **The 50s**, and **Pop Chord Progression** and their variations should be explored in common keys - if not all keys.

*The common keys are:*

- For **Folk**, **Country**, **Bluegrass**, **Rock**, and **Pop** are **C G D E A**. These have been the popular keys ever since the Folk boom (1948 into the 50s and 60s). Driven by the open position chords and their common keys on the guitar, as the guitar replace the piano as the most popular instrument on popular culture.
- For **Jazz** the common keys are: **C F Bb Eb Ab Db** and the lone sharp key of **G**. This comes form the Big Band era and the dominance of horn and their keys.

You can throw in **F** and **Bb** for common keys for ukulele as these are easy ksys on the uke.
