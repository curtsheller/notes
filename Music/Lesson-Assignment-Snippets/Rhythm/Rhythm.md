# Rhythm

This will be a bit of a refersher course on rhythm. It does use the Modular Phonetic Rhythm Sutem developen by Chuck Anderson which is an evolutionary approach to teaching rhythm that I've had great success with.

Take a look at the book: [**Modular Phonetic Rhythm, The Foundation and Workbook 1** =>>](https://learningukulele.com/books/code/MPRS-FW1)

Do a quick read through of the book and then use the worksheets for stumming patterns.

# Strums

**“A strum is the execution of a rhythmic pattern, in a specific style, at tempo.”**

As suck, there all the Modular Phnetic Rhythmic pairs can be used as strums and finger picking patterns as well as improv. There is a lot of imformation there.

### Practice Tips

Goal it to get the metronome to 102bpm or faster. At that point tthe counting is become interalized and second nature. It has transitioned  to a reflexive response.

1. Monotone - one note.
2. Single Chord
3. Switch Chords each measure
4. Improvised melodies. Can be totally random notes (jazz ;-) or use a scale.
