`Script for Thursday streaming`

`start the show with an improvisation on C and G/G7 for a few minutes and then stop and Name What Just Happened and ask a few questions.`

`AFTER IMPOV and Show Title`

## October Improvisation in C Major Number 2
We humans have a desire to want to name everything. Which is actually a good thing, as it allows us to have a way of recalling and communicating with other fellow humans.

With music, as soon as you compose a piece of music. Whether it's a song, big music score, bumper for radio, etc., - you need or what to name it. This has probably gone on forever and is actually one of the harder parts of writing music - especially instrumental music.  Pat Metheny, the one of only four guitarists in the Jazz Hall of Fame and a prolific composer with hundreds of songs, says just that. It is one of the hardest parts - simply to come up with a name for music with no words - Pat said, it's so subjective, it could be anything.

My name for today's improvisation, "October Improvisation in C Major Number 2" is actually very objective as it was improvised on October 7th and was based on chords in the key of C major." Could have gone with something subjective like "Autumn Mist", which is left up to interpretation by the listener as to the meaning. - but it simply was what first came to mind. And, a cool name.

## So What is Improvisation

We can turn to any dictionary and get a definition. Here is what Wikipedia has to say about Improvisation: **Improvisation** is the activity of making or doing something not planned beforehand, using whatever can be found. Improvisation in the performing arts is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. - *Wikipedia*

The one part of the definition from Wikipedia, the "without specific of scripted preparation" is somewhat right. However, one does need "preparation" before you can effectively improvise. For our purposes and in the music context, I'll simply say it is Spontaneous Composition - both melodic and harmonic.

The "whatever can be found.", is using what historically has been "found" to improvise in the past.

You can think of any melody that you are familiar with, as *scripted*. Someone composed and wrote it down, and or recorded it.

### What Do We Need to Do to Improvise?

To affectively *Improvise* in music, on any instrument. You need a solid foundation to draw from. That is what this series of weekly Thursday Streams is going to focus on for a few weeks. We will draw from the same sources as everyone else and benefit from what has come before us.

`aside * improvising, playing lead is one of the things that I see the a uke jam that very, very few can do or at least most are afraid to do`

We can use all the resources and material that goes into composing a melody to improvise a melody on the fly. These sources are: scales, intervals, arpeggios - i.e. chord tones, and sequences. We will address each of those and learn how to spontaneously compose instant melodies, licks, riffs, motives, or whatever you want to call them.

`aside: scales vs. chords`

## Scales
It all starts from scale, which are simply a collection of notes that fit a particular tonality or key. Note, there is a couple of terms in this that we will need to address: **Tonality** and **Key**.

For now, I'll simply tell the name of this collection of notes called a scale, and we'll explore where we can find them on the Ukulele fingerboard.
