# Piano Chords

- [One Exercise - All The Chords](https://youtu.be/imUE52htAmc) &bull; Voicing simple 7th chords in every key is something all jazz pianists (and pianists who play from lead sheets in general) should be able to do. Without getting too fancy with 9ths and 13ths and altered tones, I'd like to help you be able to simply voice all major, minor, dominant and half diminished chords simply and beautifully with this very musical exercise.
