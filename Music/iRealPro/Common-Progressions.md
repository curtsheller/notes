## iRealPro Backing tracks

Here is a [link to the iRealPro site â‡’>](https://www.irealpro.com/). The app is an available for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Android. This is a great practice tool. Essentially, join the band to try stuff out, and they don't even know or care about any of the clunker that you'll play.

These progressions are in C as the default. You can and should explore these and change to any other and style.

### One Chord Progressions
If a song has one chord, it's probably going to be the **Tonic** (I) chord of the key.

- [I, e.g. C](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I.html)
- [I7, e.g. C7](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I7.html)

### Two Chord Progressions Using the Primary Major Chords
If it's two chords, there is a good chance that it is these two. The Primary **Tonic** (I) and **Dominant** (V) chords in a Major Key.
- [V, e.g. C](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_V.html)
- [I V7, e.g. C](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_V7.html)
They're three primary chord in every major key/scale. The **Tonic** (I), **Sub Dominant** (IV), and the **Dominant** (V). Here is a two chord progression, use the I and IV. Not as common as just two chords. But, really common with what follows next.
- [I IV, e.g. C](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_IV.html)

### Three Chord Progressions Using the Primary Major Chords
- [I IV I V, e.g. C F C G](https://csp.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/students/iRealPro/progressions/I_IV_I_V.html)
