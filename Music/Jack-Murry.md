Being born in the same town as Dolly Parton (Sevierville, TN) and being kin to Merle Haggard –Jack Murray has decided to relax and enjoy the challenges of meeting such elevated expectations as both writer and performer. Jack was a founding member of country-rock band Golden Rocket in the late 70s, which featured a unique mix of folk, blues, rock & roll and traditional country music. In the 80’s, he was lucky enough to have some of his songs cut in Nashville by “Alabama” and others.

Jack has become a popular headlining act as a singer/songwriter at many venues in the Philadelphia area, including the legendary Godfrey Daniels in Bethlehem, Landhaven in Huffs Church, MusikFest in Bethlehem and twice as a featured performer at the legendary Philadelphia Folk Festival. He continues to be a popular performer at the Sellersville Theater where he has opened the show for The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, The Commander Cody Band, Chris Smither, Joe Ely and many others.

He’s had the honor of being invited to perform In The Round with Nashville songwriting legends Craig Bickhardt, Don Henry, Thom Schuyler, Tony Arata, the late (great) Michael Johnson and Poco’s Jack Sundrud. He was a featured solo guest on Gene Shay’s "The Folk Show" on WXPN in 2008 - and again in 2010 as Jack Murray and the Midnight Creeps.

When not performing solo, Jack fronts “The Blue Tarp Wranglers” –a band ready, willing and able to handle just about any kind of cool American music. The current line-up features guitarist Alan Landes, bassist Nick Franclik, pedal steel guitarist Dave Van Allen and percussionist Josh Kanusky. The Tarps’ line-up often features special musical guests as well.

Jack’s 2008 debut CD “Then There’s That...” features his unique guitar and vocal stylings and powerful original songs. A long-awaited new album is expected later this year. While the new one is still in the works, Jack recorded several tracks in Nashville in November 2017 with Thomm Jutz, David Francis, Lynn Williams and Justin Moses. A limited edition of the Nashville evidence will be released in the spring of 2018.
