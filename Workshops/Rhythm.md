Rhythm is subject is so important that I (Curt), have deceided to make if FREE for all Gold/forever site members of the LearningUkulele.com site.

Rhythm, is that one subject that we can utilize the skills we learned when we first started to talk, read, and communicate. It is a lot easier that we are lead on to believe and there really isn't any math involved.
