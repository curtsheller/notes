# Repair: Floyd Rose Setup

DIRECTIONS FOR USE: First, loosen the spring claw, then insert a Trem Block between the sustain block and the body of the guitar. Push the block in as far as necessary to make the bridge sit parallel to the face of the guitar. Once you have the strings tuned to pitch and dialed in, simply tighten the spring claw screws a quarter turn at a time until the block falls out. When it falls, your bridge is in perfect equilibrium and your guitar is ready to dive bomb and shriek like it was intended.
