## Developing Your Finger One Barre
The ability to place a single finger across more than one string, a “barre” is an essential technique for chords as well single notes and double stops.

One point to keep in mind when barring multiple strings, even on ukulele, is to not to barre more strings than needed.

# Six Secrets of Fingering on Ukulele

You'll hear, especially among Jazz musicians *"You need to play in every key."* This is a good goal for instruments with single, set fingerings for each Major Key. For strings instruments such as the ukulele and guitar with the capability of playing specific notes, scales, arpeggios, intervals, and melodic sequences in alternate locations along the fingerboard. This is a duanting taste with the time better spent with the playing _"Every Finger, Every String"_

As musicians, we've heard in our musical development that we should be able to play in all keys. For instruments with set fingerings and very few, if any, alternate fingerings for the same set of notes, this is a good goal. For string instruments, especially fretted instruments such as the ukulele and guitar, where there ARE alternate locations for just about every note — this is a daunting task. Granted the very top, I mean top jazz ukulele players and guitarists can possibly do this. It is most likely a direct result of exploring "Every Finger, Every String" - just as the students of Dennis Sandole and the teachers he directly influenced. Myself included as I studied with Chuck Anderson for many, many years and was required to do this.

The guitar students of Dennis Sandole
had to play whatever melodic device was part of their lessons start on “Every Finger, Every String”. His non-guitar students had to play in ALL Keys .
