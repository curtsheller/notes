# Pickleball

A pickleball court is the same size as a doubles badminton court and measures 20×44 feet. In pickleball, the same court is used for both singles and doubles play. The net height is 36 inches at the sidelines and 34 inches in the middle. The court is striped similar to a tennis court with right and left service courts and a 7-foot non-volley zone in front of the net (referred to as the “kitchen”). Courts can be constructed specifically for pickleball or they can be converted using existing tennis or badminton courts.

# Basic Pickleball Rules

    - Pickleball can be played as singles or doubles. While the rules are generally the same, there are a few changes from singles to doubles.
    - A pickleball court measures at least 30 by 60 feet. You can play it indoors or outdoors on a hard surface.

# Pickleball Serving

    - You always use an underhand serve.
    - Service contact on the ball must be made below the waist.
    - Both the serve and return serve have to bounce before hitting the ball.
    - The serve starts on the right-hand side.
    - You always use an underhand serve.

    - Both the serve and return serve have to bounce before hitting the ball.
    - The serve starts on the right-hand side.
    - The server switches sides when they win a point. No players switch sides if the receiving side wins the rally.

    - The server has to keep one foot behind the back line when serving.
    - The serve must be hit diagonally and must clear the no-volley zone.

# Pickleball Scoring

    - Only the serving side can score a point.
    - A game of pickleball is played to 11 points, and a team must win by 2 points. However, tournaments may play to a higher score.
    - If the ball touches the line, it is considered in. However, if the ball hits the line in the non-volley zone, it is out.
    - In a singles game, the scoring is called as two numbers. The first number refers to the servers’ score, and the second number is the - receiver’s score.
    - In a doubles game, the scoring is called as three numbers. The first number is the serving team’s score, the second number is the - receiving team’s score, and the third number refers to the serve number.

# Pickleball faults

Faults are moves that cause the loss of a point. A fault is committed when:

    - The ball hits the net.
    - The ball is hit out of bounds.
    - The ball is volleyed while in the no-volley zone.
    - The ball is volleyed before a bounce on the first serve and first return.
    - The ball hits a player.

# Pickleball non-volley zone

    - No volleys are allowed in the non-volley zone.
    - The non-volley zone is the area extending seven feet past the net on both sides for a total non-volley - zone of 14 feet. The non-volley zone is referred to as the Kitchen.
    - A player can be in the non-volley zone, as long as they are not volleying a ball.-
