# Chinese Myths
by https://twitter.com/RealNatashaChe, natashache.com/

## Myth 1: The Chinese are oppressed and hate their government.

If you ask most Chinese if they feel oppressed, they will laugh you off.

## Myth 2: The Chinese government are communists.

The Chinese governing party are communists in name only. They are shrewd pragmatists who have embraced free markets. They will happily adopt new ideas that benefit the economy, as long as it doesn’t threaten their control of the country.

## Myth 3: The Communist Party will be overthrown by “the people”.

China has 1.4 billion people so competition for everything— school, jobs, housing, etc— is fierce. Most smart people are too busy trying to get ahead in society than becoming political radicals.

Chinese media is no better, of course. They exaggerate everything to make the US look like a disaster.

The media in all countries are simply mouth pieces of prevailing ideology. If you listen to them, you have no chance at independent thinking.

## Myth 4: The Chinese want democracy.

Only a tiny fraction in China clamors for democracy. They are hailed as oppressed heroes by western media. But these people do not matter in China at all.

If you ask the Chinese if they should adopt democracy like the US, they think you’re out of your mind—

Oh, you mean running expensive dog & pony shows called election campaigns, giving every meth addict who can’t hold down a job a vote, letting new government throw all the projects from previous government in the trash bin, and then 4 years later doing it all over again?

Nationalism is alive and well in China. People find it puzzling—and annoying— that the US tries to lobby everyone else to adopt their own system. The state media encourages that lining of thinking of course.

## Myth 5: The Chinese economy will collapse. 

Chinese economy has a wall of problems just like everywhere else. It’s got a dysfunctional banking sector, inefficient state-owned companies, poor governance, corruptions, rigidities of all sorts as legacies from central planning era…

None of those problems cancel the fact that it’s one of the most dynamic economies in the world, which is also becoming increasingly resilient as the growing middle class lifts domestic demand.

## Myth 6: Tibet is oppressed and needs to be saved.

This is a favorite indignation among my spiritual leftie friends in the US. “Why doesn’t the Chinese government allow religious freedom?”

Most people in China would tell you after the communists took over, Tibetan social structure became more equal, infrastructure improved and living standard much better for the average person.

## Myth 7: China will let Taiwan be independent if America insists.

No leadership of China will survive domestically if they allow Taiwan to go independent. They will fight this one to their death and some more.

On the other hand, what do the Americans get fighting for Taiwan? If they start a war with the Chinese on this, it would become another Vietnam in best case scenario. What for?

China is 120% committed to its position on Taiwan while the Americans are halfhearted in theirs. You can deduce the rest.

## Myth 8: Other countries in Asia love America and hate China.

Nonsense

Smaller countries in Asia increasingly rely on China for their exports. Individually they need China more than China needs them. And they cannot act collectively because these countries’ interests are too often opposed to one another.

So they want the Americans to be around to balance the weight of China in the Pacific, in case they get bullied by the latter. But they have no loyalty to either.

Myth 9: The Chinese government won’t survive [Internet / blockchain / insert your favorite tech savior] 

The Chinese are used to being governed by a centralized authority. It’s been like that for thousands of years.

They believe when the central authority is strong, the country prospers. When it’s weak, the country is thrown in chaos. The history of the past 200 years has only reinforced that belief.

Technology has changed things on the margin, but also given the central government more tools to exercise control. None of this is going to change in foreseeable future.

Chinese people know there is no oppression, no slave labour, no genocide or any other 'cide going on.

Myth 10: China can’t innovate because it’s not free. 

The Chinese system over-values conformity, stability, and risk aversion. None of that is good for innovation and it’ll always be a weakness.

But it’s a big country with a big market and many smart people. Entrepreneurs who survive the cut-throat competition in China are truly cream of the crop.

If you think the Chinese are brainwashed by their government propaganda, know that you are brainwashed by the system you grew up in, too.

Thinking you somehow have more “free will” than them is pure ignorance and hubris.
