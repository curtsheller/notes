# RODECaster Pro

## Mute and Solo Buttons
Each microphone channel also has a mute and solo button. The mute button (red) is handy in case a channel begins to feedback, or if you need to silence one of your guests. The solo button (green) allows you to quickly listen to a single channel without having to mute all the other inputs.

Host headphones should connected to Headphone Output 1 or the 3.5mm headphone output on the front of the unit  to hear the solo and mute buttons properly.

## Tips on Speakers and Monitoring
Host needs to connect their headphones to either of the Channel 1 outputs on the RØDECaster Pro as these headphone outputs work slightly different to the other headphone outputs.

When any of the solo buttons are pressed, only the host will be able to hear the solo’d channel/s. All other guests and outputs will hear no difference. This is so the host can briefly listen to the audio on each channel on-the-fly without spoiling the flow of the podcast.

## Connecting Guests
Dedicated USB, smartphone and Bluetooth channels allow for both phone calls and online guests to be integrated into a podcast with crystal-clear audio. Each of these channels even has their own mix-minus* feed to ensure no echo is heard by any of the remote callers.


These channels can be recorded seamlessly alongside the four microphone channels. With this kind of flexibility, you could simultaneously connect a phone call on the smartphone channel, a Skype caller on the Bluetooth channel and a Zoom meeting on the USB channel with yourself and three other podcasters in the room.


## What Is USB Mix-Minus?
**Mix-minus** is a specialised mixer configuration commonly used in radio. The audio signal is routed so that phone callers hear everything but their own voices when they’re speaking with a host and/or other guests. This prevents feedback or echo, which can be particularly annoying when recording a phone call. This is usually quite complicated to set up, but the  RØDECaster Pro automatically applies this to the smartphone and Bluetooth communications channels (*mix-minus for USB must be turned on manually*).

Mix-Minus is activated for the USB channel by going to ‘Settings’ > ‘Advanced’ > ‘Audio’ > ‘Processing’ and switching on ‘USB Mix-minus'. Turning on USB mix-minus is crucial for ensuring that your guests *don't hear any echo* on calls via Zoom, Skype or other communications apps.


# OBS
### Using the RODECaster in OBS.
For the best results in OBS I've found that adding the RODECaster as an *Audio Cature Device* in the *Sources* panel for **ALL** Scenes that need audio si the best. This is alos on the RODE site docs.
