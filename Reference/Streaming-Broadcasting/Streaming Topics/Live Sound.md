## Gain
**Gain** is a measurement of how much a circuit amplifies a signal. Every time there’s an amplifier in the signal path, we call that a gain stage.

While gain is associated with boosting a signal, there are amplifiers that simply match gain, which is known as unity gain. Unity gain (labeled “U” on some preamps and faders) is the setting at which the gain stage neither increases nor diminishes the incoming signal. Ideally, you want to set up your signal flow so that there’s only one major gain boost, usually at your preamp or instrument, and only cut from there until you hit your power amps.
