# Remove Smoke Smell from Guitars
- Moisten a soft cloth with white vinegar.
- Wipe down all of your guitar's surfaces with the cloth.
- Dry the guitar with a clean, dry cloth.
- Spray an air-freshening spray with neutralizing properties onto a clean cloth and use it to wipe down the guitar.
- Dry the guitar again.
- Wipe the inside and outside of your guitar case with a cloth that has been moistened with vinegar.
- Dry the case or allow it to air-dry.
- Wrap a paper towel around a block of charcoal and place the charcoal inside the sound hole of the guitar if your guitar has a sound hole. Then place the guitar in the case and keep the instrument flat. If your guitar doesn't have a sound hole, place the piece of charcoal inside the case in an area that won't add pressure to the guitar. Shut the case and leave the charcoal inside for several days.
