**Increase** relief, turn the truss rod **counterclockwise**.  To **decrease** relief, turn it **clockwise**.

## Intonation 

With a floating bridge, strings should be changed one at a time in order to maintain its position.  However, if fretted notes play out of tune, the bridge can be relocated to make the correction.  Tune the high and low E strings to pitch, and check their 12th fret harmonic.  

Then check the tuning of the fretted note at the 12th fret.  If the pitch of the note at the 12th fret is flat relative to the pitch of the harmonic, loosen string tension and move that side of the bridge forward toward the neck.  If the pitch of the fretted note is sharp relative to the harmonic, move it back toward the tailpiece.
