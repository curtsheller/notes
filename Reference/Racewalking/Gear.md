The one detail on shoes that is critical across the board for Race Walking is a low heel, so that you can make heel contact and have the toe elevated when that occurs. This means that you are going to need to look at road racing shoes, which are less commonly made today, or something in the category of Zero Drop. Zero Drop is where the height of the heel and height of the ball of your foot are the same elevation from the ground. Shoe manufacturers have accomplished this in variety of methods and with many different amounts of midsole (the soft foam between your foot and the bottom of the shoe).
