# Summer Olympics

## Athletics at the Summer Olympics
Athletics has been contested at every Summer Olympics since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics. The athletics program traces its earliest roots to events used in the ancient Greek Olympics. The modern program includes track and field events, road running events, and **race walking** events. Cross country running was also on the program in earlier editions but it was dropped after the 1924 Summer Olympics. 

Of all the events for Race Walking this is the easiet to remember. It's very four years and has walks for men and women. The events in modern olympics have been 10km, 20km, and 50km. And, starting with the 2024 Paris Olymipcs the 50km has been dropped and the events will be a a seperate 20km and 35km for men and women. These will also be the events for the World Athletics Championships. (*see "World Athletics Championships" below.*)


# World Athletics Championships

- [World Athletics Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships)

The **World Athletics Championships** are a biennial athletics competition organized by [World Athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics) (formerly [IAAF, International Association of Athletics Federations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics)). The World Championships were started in 1976 in response to the International Olympic Committee dropping the men's 50 km walk from the Olympic programme for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, despite its constant presence at the games since 1932. The IAAF chose to host its own world championship event instead, a month and a half after the Olympics. It was the first World Championships that the IAAF had hosted separate from the Olympic Games (*traditionally the main championship for the sport*). A second limited event was held in 1980, and the inaugural championships in 1983, with all the events, and is considered the official start of the competition. Until 1980, the Olympic champions were considered as reigning World Champions. At their debut, these championships were then held every four years, until 1991, when they switched to a two-year cycle since.

The **Olympics** and the **World Athletics Championships**, formerly the IAAF World Championships have Race Walking events included. The World Athletics Championships are for Athletics a.k.a., Track and Field events. The Olympics are a massive event spanning seveal weeks, a lot of different sports, and a lot of various events with in each sport.

Now on to the non Olympic and World Atheletic Championships. Specific Race Walking championships.

The **World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships** is a racewalking event organised World Athletics (formerly [IAAF, International Association of Athletics Federations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics)). It has been held since 1961 ([Lugano Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Race_Walking_Team_Championships)), and generally on a biennial basis. Women first entered the 1979 edition. It was formerly known as the [**Lugano Cup**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Race_Walking_Team_Championships) after the city that hosted the first event, then became the [**IAAF World Race Walking Cup**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Race_Walking_Team_Championships) *until 2016* and than [**IAAF World Race Walking Team Championships**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Race_Walking_Team_Championships) *until 2018*. In 2004, a junior division was added, consisting of men and women aged under 20. Since 2008 it has been a constituent meeting of the **IAAF Race Walking Challenge** now called **World Athletics Challenge - Race Walking** (*see above*).

From 1975 to 1997 was awarded Lugano Trophy for combined team (20K + 50K). Since 1993 the medals have been awarded for the single events of the 20K and 50K teams, therefore in the 1993, 1995 and 1997 editions three team medals were assigned, from 1999 the combined was abolished and the team medals remained two until the present day.
