## International Paper Sizes
Many *paper size* standards conventions have existed at different times and in different countries. Today, the A and B series of  [ISO 216](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216) , which includes the commonly used A4 size, are the international standard used by almost every country. However, in some countries in  [the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americas)  as well as in the  [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines) , the North American series of  [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper)  sizes such as ' [Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(paper_size)) ' and ' [Legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_paper) ' is more prevalent.

# Postcard Sizes: International (A6) and US Postal Service Standards
**UPU (  )** [Universal Postal Union](http://www.upu.int/en.html)  is the organization that decides the International Standard Postcard Size. It has defined that postcards should have maximum dimensions of 235 mm × 120 mm (9.25 in × 4.72 in) and minimum dimensions of 140 mm × 90 mm (5.51 in × 3.54 in).

UPU has ambiguity regarding the thickness of postcards; hence it many times causes a lot of problems in handling and other transportation.  [US Postal Service](https://www.usps.com/)  tries to solve this problem by the introduction of a standard minimum and maximum thickness; along with minimum and maximum dimensions. The maximum sizes and thickness are 152.4 mm × 107.9 mm (6.0 in × 4.25 in) and 0.406 mm (0.016 in) respectively.
