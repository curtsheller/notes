## Decide first how the body text will look.
- Divide the page into foreground and background.
- Make adjustments with the smallest visible increments.
- When in doubt, try it both ways.

Don’t try to resolve typographic decisions with logic. There’s no substitute for making samples of two options and getting a visual reaction.

*Be consistent.*

- Relate each new element to existing elements.
- Keep it simple.
- Imitate what you like.
- Don’t fear white space.

For most text, the optimal line spacing is between 120% and 145% of the point size.

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefgh
