## A4 Bleed Sizes

- *216mm x 303mm*

The industry standard for a bleed is to have **3mm** of **bleed** on each edge and a **3mm** safe zone inside. This means that the *length* of each side will be **6mm** longer. For example an *A4 sheet* when lined up correctly with *bleed* will be **216mm** x **303mm**. It will then be cut down to its finished *size* of  **210mm** x **297mm** (A4).
