## Quotes
* Always use smart quotes.
* Don’t use quotation marks for emphasis. Use bold or italic.
* Always put exactly one space between sentences.

### In HTML
Another option is to use the little-known q tag, which automatically appends curly quotes to the enclosed elements. So <q>Hello</q> renders as Hello. Two caveats. First, a parent element (like html) must have a lang attribute (like lang="en") so the q tag knows what kind of curly quotes to use. Second, this change in markup removes the quote marks from the character stream, and doesn’t help with apostrophe.

## Question Marks and Exclamation Marks
The question mark is underused. Many times, you can make a topic sentence simpler and pithier by presenting it in the form of a question.
The exclamation point is overused. Give yourself a budget of one exclamation point for any document longer than three pages. If you must use it, use it wisely.

## emoticons & emoji
OK in email or texts, not in formal writing.

## parentheses, brackets, and braces
Parentheses are for separating citations or other asides from the body text. Brackets show changes within quoted material. Braces—sometimes known as curly brackets—are not typically used except in technical and mathematical writing.

## hyphens and dashes
Hyphens and dashes look similar, but they’re not interchangeable.

## Ampersands
The ampersand is typographic shorthand for the word and. The ampersand is halfway between a ligature and a contraction —it’s a stylized depiction of the Latin word et.

## Ellipsis
An ellipsis (plural ellipses) is a sequence of three dots used to indicate an omission in quoted material.

## apostrophes
*Make sure they’re curly and point downward*
The apostrophe has two functions we all remember from sixth-grade English class.
An apostrophe indicates the possessive case (Jessica’s bagel).
In contractions, an apostrophe takes the place of letters or numbers that have been removed (is not becomes isn’t, Patent No. 5,269,211 becomes ’211).
Okinas point upward, so use an opening single quote as your okina, not an apostrophe.

## foot and inch marks
*Use straight quotes, not curly*
Foot and inch marks—also known as minute and second marks or prime and double prime marks, depending on what they’re labeling—are not curly. Use straight quotes for these marks.
