# Harmony
## Tonality

**Tonality** is the arrangement of pitches and/or chords of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived relations, stabilities, attractions and directionally. In this hierarchy, the single pitch or triadic chord with the greatest stability is called the tonic. The root of the tonic chord forms the name given to the key; so in the key of C major, the note C is both the tonic of the scale and the root of the tonic chord (which is C–E–G).

A chord in isolation can belong to many keys or no key. When used in a chordprogresfsions with other chords it can only belong to in tonality or key.

A chords name is determined by it harmonic function. I.e, how it is being used.

Tonality is established by using tones of a scale as chord roots in vary degrees in support of a central tonic.

The main support to a tonic is the dominant and subdominant of a key in balanced support by the medians and sub mediant chords.

## Minor Keys
Derived from three scales: **Natural Minor** (Aeolian), **Harmonic Minor**, **Melodic Minor**.

The **Harmonic Minor** scale evolved out of the need for the Dominant scale degree, the V chord to be a major and not minor as in the Natural Minor scale. This allows minor tonalities to function in a Tonic / Dominant  fashion the same as Major tonalities function.

The **Melodic Minor** scale came about to eliminate to awkward melodic leap in the Harmonic Minor scale between the sixth and leading tone seventh scale degrees by either raising the sixth or lowering the seventh one step.

The **Melodic Minor** scale solved this by using both solutions by raising the sixth when ascending and lowering the seventh when descending.
* The *ascending* part of the Melodic Minor scale is also know as the Jazz Minor, Ionian b3 scale. 
* The *descending* part is the same as the Natural Minor scale.

## Secondary Dominant
“Any degree of the scale may be preceded by its own dominant harmony without weakening the ;fundamental harmony” - Walter Piston

“A Secondary Dominant chord is defined as *any seventh chord*built on a scale root that *resolves*up a perfect fourth or down a perfect fifth to a full diatonic chord. These chords function as a dominant (V) chord to the next chord, serving to temporarily tonicize the following chord having it act as a I chord. “ - Chuck Anderson / Curt Sheller


## Scale Degree
In music theory, **scale degree** refers to the position of a particular note in a scale relative to the tonic, the first and main note of the scale from which each octave is assumed to begin. Degrees, 1 2 3 4 etc are useful for indicating the size of intervals and chords, and whether they are major or minor. Examples would include major second (M2), perfect fourth (P4), minor third (m3), diminished fifth (dim5), augmented fifth (aug5).

## Steps
In the diatonic scale, a **step** is either a minor second (also called a half step) or a major second (also called whole step), with all intervals of a minor third or larger being skips. For example, C to D (major second) is a step, whereas C to E (major third) is a skip.
In the major scale or any of its modes, a step will always be a movement of 1 or 2 semitones.
