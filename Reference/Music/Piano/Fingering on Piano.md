# Chords

A rule to remember when you are trying to work out the basic fingerings for playing piano chords is that if the distance between any two notes in chord is **more** than a *minor third* or **less** than a *minor third*, you will use the finger combination **1**,**2**,**5**.

If your fingers can play a chord when your hand lies on the piano keyboard, each finger can play a note in the chord with fairly even spaces in-between - "the fiver-finger position". In these cases, you will then use the finger combination **1**,**3**,**5**.

## C Root Inversion
- Fingerings: 5-3-1 (LH) 1-3-5 (RH)

## C/E (1st Inversion)
- Fingerings: 5-3-1 (LH) 1-2-5 (RH)

## C/G (2nd Inversion)
- Fingerings: 5-2-1 (LH) 1-3-5 (RH)
