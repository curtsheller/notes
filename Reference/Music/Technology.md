Double-blind test proves that violins made from carbon/flax fiber sound just as good as their wooden counterparts

A **jury of experts** greatly appreciated the sound of **violins made from carbon or flax fiber**, according to a **double-blind test** conducted by **Ghent University** and **HoGent School of Arts**.

String instruments are **traditionally** **made of wood**. The **soundboard** (the principal part of the instrument), in particular, is usually made from a certain type of **pinewood** (Spruce, Maple). Duerinck was curious whether you could achieve an equivalent sound with different materials.

He built **five identical violins**, **each with a different soundboard**. One had a soundboard made from pinewood, while the other four soundboards were made from **plastic** that has been **combined in different ways** with **flax fiber** or **carbon fiber**.

For violins, or any other instrument for that matter, composites with carbon and flax fiber are particularly interesting in terms of durability and reliability. They are both light and strong, sufficiently stiff, but difficult to break.

### Benefits
composite materials, one can build **sturdy** and **reliable** instruments that are much **less sensitive to climate** and can **take a beating** as well. In addition, *unlike wooden violins*, you can **partially automate the production** of composite violins, and it is **easy to make 'copies'** of the same instrument, with more or less the **exact same properties**. 

### Double-blind test

- tHE CREATED A meticulously designed a so-called **double-blind experiment** in which a blindfolded violinist played the violins behind a folding screen without knowing which one she was holding. The experiment even went so far as to mask the scent of the violins with perfume.


Opinions on which violin had the best sound differed. Both violins made with carbon fiber and flax fiber scored well. As expected, the violin with wooden soundboard scored well too, but surprisingly, not significantly better than the instruments made from composites.
