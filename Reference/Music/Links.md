## **The Music Theory Song (Intervals Roasting)**
- A parody of “The Christmas Song” by Bob Wells and Mel Torme. Original parody lyrics by David Rakowski. Additional lyrics and vocal performance by Dave Swenson. Message me for a pdf of the leadsheet. FYI, the notation is in C major, but I transposed the accompaniment track to Bb to better suit my vocal range.
