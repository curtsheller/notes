# Book: Modular Phonetic Rhythm, The Foundation and Workbook 1

- [Modular Phonetic Rhythm, The Foundation and Workbook 1](https://learningukulele.com/books/code/MPRS-FW1), this is the book that I use, with great success for all students.

- Level II Pairs [Worksheet](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/MPR22)

These are 36 rhythm pairs that are in turn 36 possible strumming and fingerpicking patterns.

- Monotone (on single notes)
- Single Chord
- Switch Chords
- Improvised Melody

The only thing to watch out for on ukulele is, if strumming down and up, to always strum  on the downbeat. This locks us in with the "pulse" of the rhythm and which is typically lines up with the downbeats.
