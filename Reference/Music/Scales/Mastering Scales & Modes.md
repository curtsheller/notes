Mastering Scales & Modes
All scales/modes can be referenced off of the *Major* / *Ionian* Scale ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ) for comparison and ease of retention.

## Modes
* ***Ionian*** ( /Major/ )
	*C D E F G A B C’*, *1* 2 3 4 5 6 7 

* ***Dorian*** ( /Minor/ )
	*C D Eb F G A Bb C’*, 1 2 b3 4 5 *6* b7

* ***Phrygian***
	*C D Eb F G A Bb C’*, 1 *b2* b3 4 5 b6 b 7 

* ***Lydian***
	*C D E F# G A B C’*, 1 2 3 *+4* 5 6 7

* ***Mixolydian*** 
	*C D E F G A Bb C’* ( /Dominant/ ), 1 2 3 4 5 6 *b7* 

* ***Aeolian***
	*C D Eb F G Ab Bb C’* ( /Natural Minor/ ), 1 2 *b3* 4 5 b6 b7 

* ***Locrian***
	*C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C’*, 1 b2 b3 4 *b5* b6 b7

When referring to a mode all scale degrees are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. It is only when comparing or deriving from a major scale that the use of sharps and flats are needed.

### Characteristic Scale Steps

* *Dorian* 6th
* *Phrygian* 2nd
* *Lydian* 4th
* *Mixolydian* 7th
* *Aeolian* 3rd
* *Locrian* 5th
* *Ionian* 1st 

### Summary of Characteristic Chords
The /primary/ /chords/ of a mode are the I and the major and minor triads that contain the characteristic scale step. The /secondary/ /chords/ are the remaining major and minor chords. There is one lone diminished triad in each mode.

*Dorian* I, II and IV 
*Phrygian* I, II and VII 
*Lydian* I  I, II and VII 
*Mixolydian* I, V and VII 
*Aeolian* I, III and VI 
*Locrian* I, III and V 
*Ionian* I, IV and VI 

## Mode - Major Scale Relationship

* *Dorian*(7 ) - *C Dorian* same notes as *Bb* Major
* *Phrygian*(6 ) - *C Phrygian* same notes as *Ab* Major
* *Lydian* (5 ) - *C Lydian* same notes as *G* Major
* *Mixolydian*(4 ) - *C Mixolydian* same notes as *F* Major
* *Aeolian*(3 ) - *C Aeolian* same notes as *Eb* Major
* *Locrian*(2 ) - *C Locrian* same notes as *Db* Major
* *Ionian*(1 ) - *C Ionian* same notes as *C* Major

## Traditional Scales

* *Harmonic Minor* [ 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 7 ]
	C D Eb F G Ab B C’

* *Melodic Minor* ( Tonic Minor, Jazz Minor, Ionian b3 ) [ 1 2 b3 4 5 6 7 ]

The *Melodic Minor* is 1 2 b3 4 5 6 7 ascending and the Natural Minor / Aeolian scale descending.
		
/ascending/ *C D Eb F G A B C’* /descending/ *C D Eb F G Ab Bb C’*
		
In contemporary music only the ascending version is used.
	
* *Diminished -**alternating half and whole steps*
* 
	* *Whole Half*
	* *Half Hole *

* *Whole Tone -**all whole steps*

## Altered Scales

* ***Mixolydian +4*** ( /Lydian Dominant/ ) [ 1 2 3 #4 5 6 b7 ]
* ***Mixolydian -2 -6*** or b9 b13 [ 1 b2 3 4 5 b6 b7 ]
* ***Altered***  ( /Altered Dominant/ ) [ 1 b2 #2 3 b5 #5 b7 ]. A /jazz/ scale better numbers as:  1 b9 #9 3 #11 /b13 b7
* ***Super Locrian***  - raise the 4th of Locrian 1 b2 b3 #4 b5 b6 b7. 
	C Db Eb F#
The altered scale appears sporadically in the works of  [Debussy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy)  and  [Ravel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ravel) 

## Contemporary Scales
* **Blues** ( Minor Pentatonic )
[  1 b3 4 5 b7 ]
With the addition of a sharp 4/flat 5 it is what is known as the blues scale. 
Without the additional it is the Minor Pentatonic

Blues scale consists of the  [minor pentatonic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale#Minor_pentatonic_scale)  plus the b5th

* ***Pentatonic*** ( Major Pentatonic ) [  1 2 3 5 6 8 ]

## Bebop Scales
A bebop scale is a traditional scale with an extra chromatic passing tone to keep chords tones on the downbeats when starting on a chord tone and playing eight notes on 4/4 time.

* ***Dorian*** [ 1 2 b3 3 4 5 b6 b7 ]
* ***Dominant*** ( Mixolydian ) [ 1 2 3 #4 5 6 b7 *7* ]
* ***Major*** ( Ionian ) [ 1 2 3 4 5 *#5* 6 7 ]
* ***Melodic Minor***  [ 1 2 34 5*#5* 6 7 ]
* ***Harmonic Minor***  [ 1 2 33 4 5 b6 *6* 7 ]

## Hexatonic Pentatonic
* *Pentatonic*[  1 2 3 5 6 8]
* *Hexatonic Lydians*
* *Lydian**Pentatonic* ( +4 )
* *Hexatonic Mixolydian**Pentatonic* ( b7 
* *Hexatonic Ionian**Pentatonic* ( 7 )


## Hexatonic Blues

* *Aeolian**Blues* ( b6 )
* *Phrygian**Blues*  ( b2 )
* *Hexatonic Locrian*
