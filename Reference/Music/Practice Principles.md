# Practice Principles

I would advocate not actually calling it practice, think of it as exploring.


- See Chuck Anderson’s guest article title:  [**Practice, Play and Rules (Theory) - The Three Words**](https://learningukulele.com/lessons/code/%20ML-basic-20)

1. Exploration, The Principles, The Work
2. Establish a long term musical goal, and keep it in mind at each practice session.
3. Focus on your weaknesses, not on your strengths. Work only on the weaknesses that are relevant to your long term musical goals (Principle No. 1).
4. Set a short-term goal before each practice session, so you know how to use the first 10 minutes before you start. Don’t compare the end of a previous session to the start of the current session.
5. Practice what you don’t know — NOT what you DO know.
6. If your practice sounds particularly good, it doesn’t count towards your practice session. Save that for rehearsing and performances.
7. Don’t practice anything wrong; **not one single note or one beat**. When in doubt, triple check the note or beat. Then double-check it again.
8. Don’t play pieces or songs through from beginning until end; work on parts or pieces of songs. Save that for rehearsing or performances (no 4).
9. Leave your instrument out, or, if you’re a singer, leave your music out on a music stand, in a place where you will see it every day. If your instrument is your voice, it’s always out and with you - great for anytime practice.
10. Practice for at least 10 minutes every day. If you miss days, don’t give up. Just get back on schedule. Short sessions are better than no sessions.
11. Don’t practice the same thing, in the same order, that you did the day before. Explore all possible variations.
12. Goof off AFTER you have worked on your goals for that session.
