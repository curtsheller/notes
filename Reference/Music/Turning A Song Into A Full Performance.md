# Turning A Song Into A Full Performance

## Form

- **Intro**, Introduction
- **Head**, this is the melody for the song. Song or performed instrumentally
- **Solo**
- **Head**
- **Ending**

## Into or Not to Intro

- Decide **Yes** or **No**
- If **YES** the Head is a good place to create an intro form

## Head

- As written
	- Once if a long form such as a 32 bar AABA song form
	- Twice is short like a 12 bar Blues

## Solo Section

An interlude can precede the solo section.

- Decide if there is a solo section
	- Same chord changes as the Head or fresh progression or vamp.
	- Modal
		- If Modal it is good to set the Mode in the Head section.
- Basic as in a 12 Bar Blues

## Repeat Head

## Ending
