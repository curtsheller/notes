# Dizzy Gillespie had six skills for a jazz musicians. 

These are appropriate for any instrument and style of music would like to perform and communicate.

These six steps are:  **Mastery of Instrument**, **Developing a Personal Style**,  **Taste**,  **Communication**. **Chord Progressions and Rhythm**.

1. **Mastery of Instrument**
    “Important because when you think of something to play, you must say it quickly because you don’t have time to figure how, chords changing so quickly.”

2. **Style**
    “Which I think is the most difficult to master in as much as there are not too many truly distinctive styles in all of jazz.”

3. **Taste**
    “Is a process of elimination. Some phrases that you play may be technically correct but do not portray that particular mood that you are trying for.”

4. **Communication**
    “After all, you make your profession jazz because first, you love it and secondly, as a means of livelihood. So if there is no direct communication with the audience for which you are playing…………there goes your living.”

5. **Chord Progressions**
    “As there are rules that govern you biologically and physically, there are rules that govern your taste musically. Therefore, it is of prime interest and to one’s advantage to learn the keyboard of the piano, as it is the basic instrument for Western music which jazz is an integral part of.”

6. **Rhythm**
    “Which includes all of the other attributes because you may have all of these other things but don’t have the rhythmic sense to put them together, then it would negate all of your other accomplishments.”
