Existing memories are recalled and modified with new knowledge.

Here's a simple example: trying to get better at shooting free throws in basketball. The conditions are fixed. The rim is always 10 feet above the floor. The free throw line is always 15 feet from the basket.

In theory, shooting from the same spot, over and over again, will help you ingrain the right motions into your muscle memory so your accuracy and consistency will improve.

And, of course, that does happen — but a better, faster way to improve is to slightly adjust the conditions in subsequent practice sessions.

Maybe one time you'll stand a few inches closer. Another time you might stand a few inches to one side. Another time you might use a slightly heavier, or lighter, ball.

In short, each time you practice, you make the conditions a little different. That primes the reconsolidating pump — and helps you learn much more quickly.

## But Not Too Different — or Too Soon

But you can't adjust the conditions more than slightly. Do something too different and you'll simply create new memories — not reconsolidated ones.
