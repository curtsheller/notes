# Notes of the Neck
In the business world, they have an acronym **ROI**, *“Return On Investment.”* Learning the names of the Ukulele fingerboard notes is one of the areas that will return big time. It’s not the easiest to do as it is pure memorization - but well worth the time.

## Key Frets

Start with the frets that have no sharps or flats are one of the seven letters, natural notes of music: **A B C D E F G**.

- Open Strings: **G C E A**
- fret(5): **C F A D**
- fret(7): **D G B E**
- fret(12) same as the open strings: **G C E A**

From the****_Key Frets_****you can get the derived frets, the next higher by sharping (#) each note and the previous lower frets by flatting (b) each note for:

### Derived Frets - Sharps

It’s all about learning and building on know information. Know the key frets open, fret five, and fret seven you can derive the names of the previous and higher frets.

A **Sharp** raises a note one half-step, one fret.

- **fret(1)** from the *Open Strings*: **G# C# E# A#**
- **fret(6)** from *fret(5)*: **C# F# A# D#**
- **fret(8)** from *fret(7)*: **D# G# B# E#**

### Derived Frets - Flats

A **Flat** lowers a note one half-step, one fret.

- **fret(4)** from *fret(5)*: **Cb Fb Ab Db**
- **fret(6)** from *fret(7)*: **Db Gb Bb Eb**
- **fret(11)** from *fret(12)*: **Gb Cb Eb Ab**

# The Chromatic Scale
The only scale in music with ALL twelve notes of one octave. Not much use for improvisation or solos – but an excellent scale for learning the notes of the ukulele fingerboard, figuring out scales, chords, and more.

- A A# **B C** C# D D# **E F** F# G G# then starts over with A.

Notice that there are no notes between E and F or B and C. These are the two areas on the standard black and white piano keyboard with no black key between them.
