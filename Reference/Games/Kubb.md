<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/90462459">Kubb Rules!</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/skymotionmedia">SkyMotion Media</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.

There are two phases for each team’s turn: 

1. **Team A** throws the six batons (called Kastpinne/Kastpinnar in Swedish) from their baseline, at their opponent’s lined-up kubbs (called Baseline kubbs). Throws must be under-handed, and the batons must spin end over end. Throwing batons overhand, sideways or spinning them side-to-side (helicopter) is not allowed.
2. Kubbs that are successfully knocked down by Team A are then thrown by Team B onto Team A’s half of the pitch, and stood on end. These newly thrown kubbs are called *field kubbs*. The key objective is to keep them close to each other (as to be able to hit more than one with a single throw of the batons (Kastpinnar)). The player that tosses the kubbs is called the inkastare.

### Lag for Who Goes First

* The baton may touch the king, but cannot knock it over.
* In the event of a tie, or if the king falls after having been impacted by both teams’ batons, re-throw until there is a clear winner.
* On the second and third games of a match teams switch sides and throwing order.

### Variations

At the World Kubb Championship in Sweden, they have recently adopted a new rule for the lag. It no longer is the closest baton, it is now **the closest baton end**. This means even if the side of one baton is touching the king and the other baton is a few centimeters away, that non-touching baton would be determined the winner if its end is closer to the king.
