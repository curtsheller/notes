# Esperanto

## Pronunciation

- The letters **A**, **E**, **I**, **O**, and **U** are vowels. All other letters are consonants. Every letter must be pronounced. Silent letters don't exist in Esperanto. https://lernu.net/en/gramatiko/skribo

## Grammar

- Singular means that there is one. Plural means that there is more than one. The plural is indicated by the ending J. Use the J-ending with nouns, adjectives and correlatives ending in U, and A. https://lernu.net/en/gramatiko/singularo_pluralo

- All nouns in Esperanto end with -o. (Nouns are names of thÄ±ngs.)

- To make a word plural, add a -j:

- In Esperanto, we show the direct object of a sentence by adding an -n. This lets us change the order of the parts of the sentence without changing the meaning. (A direct object is that which is directly acted upon by the verb)

- All adjectives in Esperanto end with -a. (Adjectives are used to describe nouns.)

- Check this out! Adding mal- to the beginning of a word gives it the opposite meaning.

- Infinitives end in -i. In the present tense, verbs always end in -as, in the past in -is, and in the future in -os. There are no irregular verbs!
