## How long should I isolate or quarantine with a breakthrough infection?

If you don’t have any symptoms but have tested positive for the coronavirus, you should isolate from others for 10 full days, beginning the day after you took the test. If you develop symptoms during that time, you must start the clock over, according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If you are symptomatic, start the 10-day period after first developing symptoms, the CDC said.

While isolation is for people who have been infected, quarantine is for those who have been only exposed and possibly infected. People who have come into close contact with an infected person may need to quarantine. The CDC defines close contact as being within six feet for 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.

## If others in my household are sick, too, can we be together?

Yes, assuming everyone in the household has contracted the virus, there’s no longer a need to separate from them, experts said.

Electrolyte fluids such as Gatorade and Pedialyte can ease symptoms and prevent you from becoming dehydrated. It is good to have a few of these in your fridge.

It is also worth keeping extra masks handy. N95s, KN95s and surgical masks are now easy to order online.

## How long will I be contagious?

You are considered contagious during the entire 10-day isolation period. Although it’s unlikely, if symptoms such as a cough or fever persist past that point you may still be contagious, said Murphy, executive director of Northwestern’s Robert J. Havey MD Institute for Global Health.

“With these breakthroughs, the whole clinical course is so mild that many of them pretty much recover in a day or two and they’re just waiting to get out of isolation,” he said.
