Ukulele jazzer Curt Sheller at a fine house concert in Virginia last night -- introduced by host Glen -- Donna Glen Hirabayashi of the Aloha Boys -- presented an instrumental mix of extemporaneous mood-play excursions and unpredictable interpretations of his favorite songs, ranging from the familiar to the obscure -- adding doses of humor along the way -- Set list? He claimed it was his wife's list of chores and errands. Uh-oh!
