Nanaimo Ukulele Festival 2023

Fri, Jun 9, 2023

Nanaimo BC

The Nanaimo Ukulele festival began as a one day event in the summer of 2011 and was produced by Anna Lyman, a local ukulele and vocal teacher, who wanted to promote and support the growing interest in the ukulele in the Nanaimo area. What started as a one day affair has grown over the years to become a uke fest celebration attended by people from across Vancouver Island, mainland BC and other parts of North America.

Local ukulele enthusiasts and volunteers work to bring together ukulele performers and teachers from the Island and across Canada and the USA. Our goal is to create an event where we can come together to celebrate our love of the ukulele, meet with other “ukesters” and showcase the accomplished and talented ukulele players from across the continent.
