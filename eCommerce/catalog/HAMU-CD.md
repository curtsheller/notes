# How About More Uke - The Curt Sheller Trio

Motivated by our love of jazz and improvisation. Eric, Ed, and myself (Curt) explore a traditional and contemporary jazz repertoire with a sprinkling of originals, showcasing the ukulele in a non-traditional setting.

For most of the songs on the CD, I've added the melody and chord arrangement I used for the recording available to LearningUkulele.com site Gold and Forever members.
