Learn to read single note melodies in the first/open position. It is a lot easier than you might think with this step-by-step easy to use approach. Tunings: C with low or high G - (GCEA or gCEA).

Reading music is not as hard as one might think. It may be new and unfamiliar but is not hard when you have a proper plan of attack.

Reading music on the ukulele is easier than reading music on guitar or piano. There are only four strings with a smaller range of possible notes.
