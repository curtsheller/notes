# CANCELLATION POLICY

*(This is from Reno Uke Fest site)*

ALL FESTIVAL PASS SALES ARE FINAL.

Your safety is paramount and the possibility of ongoing restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic still exists. Therefore, the pass-holder areas of this year's festival will be limited to a smaller number of attendees than normal. In order to ensure that we can produce a festival of the same quality you have come to expect, we must work with financial certainty and will not issue refunds for any reason.

 
However, we realize that "life happens," therefore, PASSES ARE FULLY TRANSFERABLE. You are welcome to gift or resell your passes at any time before they are claimed at registration. We will assist you with reselling by adding a “sticky post” to our Facebook page and a listing on our website where you can post your contact information offering passes for resale. All privacy and private sale risks are assumed by you, the pass owner.

 
If you resell or otherwise wish to transfer passes, please send an email to playukemail@gmail.com, and include:


- “Pass Transfer” as the subject line

- The name(s) the pass was purchased under

- The name(s) of the new pass-holder

- The number and types of passes being transferred.

Should the festival be delayed again for any reason, all registration information will automatically be credited toward the new festival dates.
