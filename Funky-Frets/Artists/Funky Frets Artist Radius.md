# Funky Frets Artist Radius

We directly draw from Philadelphia area that would affect the number of attendees to any Funky Frets event. You would be splitting your draw. We don’t take any cut of ticket sales. We do it to support your touring and promote our store.

The King of Prussia area is only a little over 20 miles from Funky Frets. And, Philadelphia is only a little over 30 miles away.

( *Radius map is in Photos* or saved on one of the computers somewhere.).

**40 miles** and out would probably be OK and not affect the draw to the event.

Let us know what’s going on and keep us in the loop. The Mainline group has not contacted us directly.
