# Teaching Philosophy

## Chuck Anderson's Teaching Philosophy

1) Students are welcome at every level from beginner to advanced.
2) The goals of the student are primary - not the goals of the teacher.
3) Lessons are not intended to teach songs but rather to teach the principles that lie beneath songs.

- My goal is not to teach you songs but to teach you the principles that are inherent in every song. Allowing to learn any song you would like to learn.

4) Short frequent practice is often more effective that long-drawn-out practice.
5) I don't motivate students but I do help them find their own motivation.
6) I deal with any topic that helps the student achieve his or her goals.
7) Every student learns in his or her own way. There is no "one size fits all" in teaching.
8) There is no assignment that everyone must do.
9) Don't underestimate the value of 30 seconds of practice.
10) Use time wisely and efficiently.
11) I consider Rhythm through Modular Phonetics to be an important though frequently neglected topic.
12) I do not believe in <q>riffs</q>.
13) It's important that we develop the Mind, Hands, Ear and Creativity in a holistic way.
14) Perseverance is more important than "talent".
15) Always get to the lesson. The time spent at a lesson is even more important than practice.
16) Don't let a lack of preparation stop you from getting to your lesson.
17) There is always something valuable to do at a lesson.
18) Lessons are not school and the practice you do at home is not homework.
19) There are no deadlines on learning anything.
20) Always concentrate on your own voice &mdash; your own unique personality.
21) As long as you don't give up, you will be moving in the right direction.
22) The reason to teach is to help those who have asked for help.
23) Generally, what sounds good is good.
24) Music is not a competition.
25) Reading music is not mandatory but it's helpful.
26) There are no shortcuts but there are many ways to learn efficiently.
27) Don't ignore fundamentals in the race to get advanced.
28) Slow and controlled leads to virtuosity.
29) There are no tests.
30) Recognize why each student is taking lessons. Don't assume that everyone has the same goals, reasons or motivations.
