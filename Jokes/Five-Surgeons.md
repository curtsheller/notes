Five surgeons were discussing which were the best patients on which to operate.

The first surgeon said, "I like to see accountants on my operating table, because when you open them up  everything inside is numbered." 

The second surgeon responded,
â€œYou should try electricians!  Everything inside them is color coded." 

The third surgeon said, "I really think librarians are the best. Everything inside them is in alphabetical order." 

The fourth surgeon chimed in, "You know, I like construction workers...they always understand if you have a few parts left over in the end or if the job takes longer than you said it would." 

But the fifth surgeon shut them all up with this observation, "You're all wrong. @GOP
 politicians are the easiest to operate on. There's no guts, no heart, no spine and the head and ass are interchangeable."
