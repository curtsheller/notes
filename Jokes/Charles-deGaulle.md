When Charles deGaulle decided to retire from public life the British ambassador and his wife threw a gala dinner party in his honor.

At the dinner table, the Ambassador's wife said to Madame deGaulle: "Your husband has been such a prominent public figure, such a presence on the French and international scene for so many years.”

“How quiet retirement will seem in comparison. What are you most looking forward to in these retirement years?"

"A penis," replied Madame deGaulle.

A huge hush fell over the table. Everyone heard her answer and no one knew what to say next.

Le Grand Charles leaned over to his wife and said, "Ma cherie, I believe ze English pronounce zat word ‘appiness!”
