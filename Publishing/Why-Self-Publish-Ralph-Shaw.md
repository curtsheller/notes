Why Self-Publish?

Getting a publisher interested in your book can seem a great opportunity but it has drawbacks. As well as being very difficult to interest a publishing house there’s also no guarantee you’ll ever see any profit once the marketing and other costs are taken into account.


My inspiration for self-publishing began with a writing coach called Daphne Gray-Grant. From her I learned how this approach offers greater control over your own work. I've now published two books and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience of working closely with an editor and a book designer to make something that people will be pleased to receive.

 

What are the downsides of Self-Publishing? 

One is stigma. In the music business the public are used to tales of musicians being ripped off by record companies and therefore understand why artists self-produce their own albums. But with books it’s a different story. Self-publishing is generally associated with poorly written vanity projects that would otherwise never get printed. 

The other downside is cost. A self-publishing author has to choose between doing the editing and book design alone (and risk doing a second-rate job because this is not their expertise) or paying experienced professionals to do the work.
