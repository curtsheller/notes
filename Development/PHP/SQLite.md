- [*Laravel Sail** &#128279;](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail) &bull; Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker development environment. Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience. **Laravel Sail** is supported on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2).
