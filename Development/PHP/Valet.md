# Valet

**Valet Linux** is a Laravel development environment for Linux minimalists. No Vagrant, no /etc/hosts file. You can even share your sites publicly using local tunnels. Yeah, we like it too.

```
sudo apt install network-manager libnss3-tools jq xsel

composer global require cpriego/valet-linux
```

**TODO:** Explore and get Laravel Sail up to replace all this PHP, Composer, MySQL, Redis, Meilisearch, etc setup.

- [*Laravel Sail** &#128279;](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail) &bull; Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker development environment. Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience. **Laravel Sail** is supported on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2).
