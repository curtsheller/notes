## Introducing UTC

*Quirico Filopanti* also proposed a universal time to be used in astronomy and telegraphy, which we call UTC.
Gremlins can't eat after midnight?! What if they travel to other time zones?!

And, according to  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)  again:
"Coordinated Universal Time (or UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is within about one second of mean solar time at 0Â° longitude, and is not adjusted for daylight saving time. 
It is effectively a successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)."
Advantages of using UTC as your one true time zone include:

1. No more need to Google other time zones. You immediately know the difference from where you stand to UTC, and that's it.
2.	Not affected by Daylight Saving Time. This advantage speaks for itself.
3.No more need to ask people where they are. You can focus on finding availability quickly and easily.
4.You can add it to your calendar by default or use it as secondary time. Most calendar solutions support this.
5.You can be pedantic about it. Like I'm doing now.

## The UTC model

When you use the UTC model, you always refer to the UTC time zone when scheduling things, even if you're not in it. The only thing you need to know is how far away from UTC, and that's it, forever.
