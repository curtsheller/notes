## Types
### PBT
### ABS

- **PBT** (Polybutylene Terephthalate) for durability
- **ABS** (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) for color vibrancy, bright vivid colros


## Printing
- **Pad-printed**: This is the most common type of legend printing found on pre-built keyboards but is less common on aftermarket keycap sets, due to lack of durability.
- **Laser-engraved**: Laser-engraved legends are most often found on keycaps with translucent legends to show RGB backlighting.
- **Dye-sublimated**: Dye-sublimation legends are created by using heat and dye to permanently stain the plastic of the keycap. These legends are very durable and will not wear out over time but can have softer edges, due to the dying process. This type of legend is most common to PBT keycaps due to their reduced wear and tear versus ABS.
- **Doubleshot**: Doubleshot keycaps are created by bonding two pieces of plastic for the legend and outer shell of the keycap. When done well, these keycaps are often the most durable and feature the most crisp legends.

_Dye-sublimated and doubleshot keycaps are the best of the four most popular varieties._
